TSA Screeners' Union Wants More Guidance On Avoiding Coronavirus,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/14/815734056/tsa-screeners-union-wants-more-guidance-on-avoiding-coronavirus,March 14, 2020,

 Passengers head for security screening at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston last year. The travel industry is reeling from the coronavirus. This week, three security screeners at the San Jose, Calif., airport tested positive for the virus, and others may have been exposed. That's fueling questions about how the TSA is protecting its employees and the public.  Union officials who represent the 45,000 or so screeners nationwide, and who come into contact with the public more than any other federal agency say they haven't been told much about how to protect themselves. "Our officers are really concerned about it and we really don't know of a plan," said Joe Shuker, president of the TSA union local in Philadelphia. "All we've been told is 'Wash your hands. Don't touch your face.' " The TSA is already in the middle of a hiring and overtime freeze because of a funding gap. Shuker says screeners are facing a shortage of protective gloves, hand sanitizers and even cleaning supplies.  "It's discouraging to know that an agency that is developed to protect the American people isn't funded to protect them, right?" he said.  On top of that, the TSA recently stopped reimbursing more than 100 airports for security checkpoint cleaning. TSA requested that $21 million earmarked for that be cut from its budget, which Congress approved last year.  Shuker says his airport in Philadelphia is one that saw its cleaning reimbursements cut, but there wasn't much communication about that except, "We didn't have the money to pay cleaners to come up and clean." According to an industry executive speaking on background, some of the nation's largest airports' cleaning reimbursements were reduced due to the budget cut. Whether that means checkpoints aren't getting cleaned is unclear. Miami International Airport spokesman Greg Chin said in a statement that there's been no interruption in cleaning there, but TSA is no longer providing funding to cover its costs.  TSA declined an interview request, and did not respond to written questions. Democrats in Congress are asking for details on what the TSA and the Department of Homeland Security are doing to protect their workers and the public.  Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., sent a letter to the Homeland Security secretary. And at a House subcommittee hearing with TSA Administrator David Pekoske this week, California Rep. Lou Correa said he's concerned and wants "to reassure the public that we're on top of this and that we're doing what we need to do to protect employees as well as the public.   "Yes, sir," Pekoske responded, "And ensuring the safety of my workforce is my top priority." Pekoske rejected a request earlier this week by the union to allow them to wear respirator masks, saying the agency is following CDC guidelines, according to emails provided to NPR. Instead, screeners are allowed to wear surgical masks, even though they may not be as effective.  On a recent afternoon at the Salt Lake City airport, Caroline Schier had just dropped off her black ski bag for screening after a long-planned vacation.  The 45-year-old family physician from Portland, Ore., says at first she thought worries over the coronavirus were overblown. But that soon changed.   "I'm taking precautions, assuming anyone could be infected," she said. She avoids touching her face and frequently washes her hands. That's the same advice TSA screeners are being given.
Trump Steps In To Help Oil Industry Facing Its Own Coronavirus Crisis,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/14/815039722/trump-steps-in-to-help-oil-industry-facing-its-own-coronavirus-crisis,March 14, 2020,

 A crew near Karnes City, Texas, continued work as oil prices collapsed this week. Companies already were cutting costs and now will have to cut deeper as oil prices remain low. Oil prices bounced back a bit after President Trump said the Department of Energy would buy crude for the nation's strategic petroleum reserve.  "We're going to fill it right to the top," Trump said Friday in a wide-ranging news conference at the White House.  He said it will save taxpayers "billions and billions of dollars" while helping an industry that's been reeling.   While oil prices increased nearly 5% after Friday's announcement, that was just a fraction of the amount they lost earlier in the week.  In South Texas, Rudy Martinez immediately experienced the effects of the past week's collapse in crude oil prices.  "I actually have a little man camp and these guys are on the way out because they lost contracts," says Martinez, who has eight rooms he rents to out-of-town oilfield workers in Karnes City, Texas.  "The workers get their per-diem and I charge them $100 a person [per week]. Actually I'd like to charge them a little more than that, but now that it's tapered off, it's hard to charge them that because they can't pay it," he says.  Back when the oil business was really booming in Karnes City, Martinez says he could charge up to $2000 a week per person.  This is one small example of what declining oil prices mean for the rural communities that depend on the oil business. And there's a lot at stake for the U.S., the world's largest producer of crude oil.  Oil prices had been falling out of fears the coronavirus epidemic threatened world economic growth.  Demand was also down as large gatherings were canceled and people started staying home to avoid getting sick.  Then prices plunged after Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to agree on production cuts and instead entered a price war last Sunday.  In a stunning reversal, Saudi Arabia said it would actually boost oil production and offer a massive discount for its customers.   U.S. oil companies, especially smaller ones, are now looking to make deep cuts. Industry analysts warn of possible bankruptcies, especially if oil remains where it's fallen to, in the $30 per barrel range. Companies operating in Texas's Eagle Ford Shale need prices between $40 to $60 a barrel to remain profitable. 'We were here before the oil' Karnes City was transformed by the oil drilling boom that started about a decade back. Karnes County National Bank President Trip Ruckman says there were local farmers and ranchers who were just getting by, then all of a sudden showed up at his bank with a $1 million oil royalty check in hand.  
                Karnes County National Bank is headquartered in the oil drilling boom town of Karnes City, Texas. Bank President Trip Ruckman says his community has survived busts in the past and will survive this one too.

 Karnes County National Bank is headquartered in the oil drilling boom town of Karnes City, Texas. Bank President Trip Ruckman says his community has survived busts in the past and will survive this one too. Right now it can still look pretty busy around town. There are trucks on the roads and a few local hotels are still full. Ruckman says it takes time for drillers to wind down production plans that already were being implemented when prices collapsed.  "Probably, in a few weeks to a month or two, I think you're going to see things slow down. But we'll still be here — we were here before the oil," says Ruckman, who tries to stay optimistic about the financial future of his community. There have been reports the Trump administration may be willing to help the oil industry in other ways. For example, the White House could reduce federal royalties for oil pumped on government land or offshore.  The administration could also offer low-interest government-backed loans.  Groups focused on climate change have criticized such ideas.  "The last people who deserve taxpayers' money are the billionaires that created and profited from the climate crisis," says Jack Shapiro of the environmental group Greenpeace.  One potential bright spot in all this is gasoline prices. Lower oil prices will mean cheaper gas for motorists in coming months.   Usually when gas prices go down people drive more and choose bigger cars, which increases consumption. But with many limiting travel out of concern over the coronavirus, this time might be the exception. 
Episode 979: Medicine For The Economy,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/815677688/episode-979-medicine-for-the-economy,March 13, 2020, President Trump just declared a national emergency. It was the second presidential address about COVID-19 this week. On Wednesday, the President offered his plans for the economy. He called for funds to provide low-interest loans to small businesses, to expand paid sick leave, and to delay tax day for certain people and businesses. He also called for a payroll tax cut which, while we don't have specific numbers, could be a massive amount of money. It was a huge week with huge proposals, and that got us thinking... are those the right proposals? So, we called up three of the smartest people we know — three economists who have studied, or even been present for, some of the greatest moments of economic crisis — to help us understand what our country should do.

Economic Fear Factor,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/815661248/economic-fear-factor,March 13, 2020, Markets have had a tough week. Stock markets, bond markets and commodities markets have tanked. Businesses are shutting their doors all over the world. And shoppers have been panic-buying everything they can get their hands on, from toilet paper to frozen peas. People are afraid. No one knows much about coronavirus, and that lack of knowledge is making people super conservative. They're canceling concerts and plays, steering clear of restaurants and staying home from school and work. That retreat from daily life, called 'aversion behavior', has a massive effect on the economy, far greater than the actual cost of the pandemic itself. Olga Jonas is a senior fellow at the Harvard Global Health Institute. She has been studying the effects of pandemics for years.

U.S. Coronavirus Testing Gets A Potential Breakthrough,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/815522836/u-s-coronavirus-testing-gets-a-breakthrough,March 13, 2020,

 National Guard personnel stand beside a line of motorists waiting for coronavirus testing in New Rochelle, N.Y., on Friday. Major retailers such as CVS, Target and Walmart are pledging to set up drive- through test sites in some of their parking lots. In what's looking more like a public health debacle, the U.S. has a serious testing problem with the coronavirus. Only around 15,000 people have been tested so far, according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And public health experts say that's not nearly enough to know how widespread the outbreak is and how to respond. But the Food and Drug Administration has just approved a new test from the giant pharmaceutical company Roche that could represent a major breakthrough. The initial test approved by the FDA is complex and requires specialized training and equipment. Until this week, some of the supplies required to do the test had to come from a single company in Germany that couldn't meet the demand. "The big players that normally sell things like the [regular flu] test kits or rapid strep test kits to hospitals, they haven't had assays authorized yet by FDA," says Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories. So in other words, the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. and the world haven't been able to pitch in and help. But that just changed in a very big way. "We're very excited to share the news that overnight we got emergency use authorization from the FDA," says Paul Brown, a senior executive for Roche. He says the company has a new test that's more simple, and quicker to get results. Roche has already begun production while it awaited FDA approval, he says. "We have about 400,000 tests that are available for the U.S. market," Brown says. And he says Roche expects to manufacture about 1.5 million tests per month. That's a lot more tests than have been administered so far. And Brown says there are about 100 Roche machines already in use across the country, each capable of processing more than of 1,000 tests per day. Michael Mina, an associate medical director of virology at Brigham and Women's hospital in Boston, says that if that kind of manufacturing pace can be kept up, "I think that will be one of the pieces that turns out to be sort of a game changer in the testing capacity in the United States." Mina and other public health experts say that dramatically ramping up testing is crucial to saving lives. Marc Lipsitch, who directs the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard's School of Public Health, says testing is needed at emergency rooms in every major metro area across the country. That would offer statistically significant sampling to get reliable estimates on how many Americans actually have the coronavirus, he says. "I think we're flying almost completely blind right now," Lipsitch says. "We have a lot of uncertainty about whether we have 10 times more or 100 times more cases than we know about." Other countries appear to have been doing a better job with testing. South Korea, by one recent count, had been testing 700 times as many people per capita as the U.S. Mina says it's striking just how unprepared the U.S. has turned out to be to face an outbreak like this. He thinks much will be learned from it. But with so much at stake, he says, "I just wish that we had really begun to take this problem seriously as a country two months ago versus really focusing on it just within the last couple of weeks." Roche says it will start shipping those first 400,000 test kits this weekend. More companies could soon follow suit with new FDA-approved tests of their own. Meanwhile, at a White House Rose Garden news conference Friday, top executives at Target, Walmart, CVS and Walgreens pledged to make space in some of their parking lots for drive-through testing. Even so, Mina thinks it could still be a few weeks before all this ramps up enough to allow for a much better estimate on just how many people have the virus in this country, and where all the hot spots are, so the infectious disease experts know how best to respond.
Not Employees: Gig Workers Like Uber Drivers Aren't Eligible For Sick Leave,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/814587903/coronavirus-puts-financial-pressure-on-uber-drivers-other-gig-workers,March 13, 2020,

 Uber and Lyft drivers say they are seeing less demand for rides in big cities where events are being canceled and people are encouraged to work from home. Joe Renice noticed things were different last week in downtown San Francisco. "I was driving around the financial district for 3 1/2 hours. I got one ride," he said. Renice is an Uber driver and normally spends a good chunk of his day ferrying tech workers and tourists around the city. But with companies including Twitter, Salesforce and Facebook advising employees to work from home and conferences and other events being canceled every day, demand for rides in many big cities has dropped. The spread of coronavirus is the U.S. is highlighting just how precarious the gig economy can be. The payroll tax cuts and sick leave policies being discussed by the Trump administration would not apply to gig workers, because they are not considered employees of companies like Uber and Lyft. If they don't drive or deliver food, they don't get paid. That is creating a lot of uncertainty for gig workers, who are grappling with whether to stay on the road at the same time that so many other people are being told to stay home or avoid crowds. Those who are still driving are spending a lot of time and money cleaning their cars. "I'm spending a lot more time on dealing with the car and disinfecting it and all that. I didn't do that before," said Edan Alva, who drives for Lyft in the Bay Area. Lyft and Uber both say they're working on providing cleaning supplies to drivers. But those supplies are limited, so for now, drivers like Alva are paying for disinfectant out of their own pockets. "You have drivers who are often, you know, only making around $15 to $20 an hour before expenses. So when you start racking up a lot of those expenses, you make less as a driver," said Harry Campbell, who runs a popular blog for drivers called The Rideshare Guy. Other drivers are making the tough choice to take a financial hit. "It's very worrying to work under these conditions," said Linda Valdivia, an Uber driver in Los Angeles. "So I am trying to drive less than before . . . because I'm being a little cautious about it." Uber, Lyft, Instacart, DoorDash and Amazon are offering financial help. But that is only available to workers who have either been diagnosed with coronavirus, or put in mandatory quarantine by public health officials. That's a limited number. Uber said it has made up missed pay for five workers in Mexico and the United Kingdom, all of whom were put in quarantine. As companies come under pressure to support workers, some are going further. Instacart is introducing sick pay for all workers. Another food delivery app, Postmates, will cover medical expenses for workers in 22 states, even if they haven't been diagnosed with the virus or quarantined. Uber, DoorDash and other companies have discussed pooling money into a fund for the many gig workers who drive or deliver for more than one service. That kind of crossover could become even more common, as more people hunker down at home and order groceries and meals for delivery. Instacart is already seeing higher demand for grocery delivery in some American cities. Campbell says he advises Uber and Lyft drivers who are nervous about exposing themselves to passengers to deliver food instead, through apps like Instacart and DoorDash. "If the virus does spread and consumers and customers stop going out as frequently," he said, "I think that's when we'll see a big shift to food delivery, sort of like what we've already seen happen in China."

 The underlying financial plumbing that allows banks and markets to operate smoothly is under strain. The stunning, rapid plunge in stock prices over the spreading coronavirus pandemic has understandably captured headlines for days.  But there's a parallel story that has received much less attention: the health of the underlying financial plumbing that allows banks and markets to operate smoothly.  That system, according to analysts, is now under strain. The worry is that bankers, traders and big funds might suddenly find themselves in a cash crunch or without quick access to credit. Such a scenario could create an ugly spiral throughout the economy.  On Thursday, the Federal Reserve noticed the market jamming up and decided to step in with an infusion of cash available to banks. The New York Fed said it was injecting the money "to address the highly unusual disruptions to Treasury financing markets associated with the coronavirus outbreak."  Treasurys — U.S. government debt — are typically widely traded. They're the grease that makes the wheels of the credit and trading system function efficiently. But in recent days, the Treasury market has become brittle.   Treasurys "are the most liquid market on the planet bar none," said Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. rates strategist for TD Securities. "When it's experiencing problems, you know something is wrong."  Normally, when there's a big stock sell-off, investors flee for the safety of U.S. Treasurys. And during the market sell-offs recently, it's exactly what has been happening. Except on Thursday.  Goldberg said the trading system was sputtering. Dealers — the banks that buy and sell under all conditions — didn't have robust enough balance sheets to meet the demand from buyers and sellers of  Treasurys.  So trading markets faltered, Goldberg said. The Fed stepped in to prevent a case of the hiccups from becoming something drastically worse. The Fed also announced a move reminiscent of dramatic actions it took during and immediately after the financial crisis of 2008. It's called quantitative easing and it's meant to relieve the cash liquidity imbalances in the financial markets. During the crisis, for instance, the Fed bought massive amounts of Treasury debt from banks, flooding the financial system with money.   Now, the Fed is doing something similar — though, so far, on a much smaller scale. As of Friday, it will be purchasing $60 billion in Treasury debt.  And next week, at its regular meeting, the Fed is expected to slash interest rates — perhaps by as much as a full percentage point — which would essentially bring them down to zero. The central bank already cut rates by a half point in an emergency move last week. All these actions are designed to support both the financial system and the broader economy from the sudden stress brought on by the coronavirus.  
Gas Prices Are Approaching $2,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/815226243/the-return-of-2-gasoline-pandemic-and-geopolitics-send-prices-down,March 13, 2020,

 Gas prices have fallen markedly, and may continue to dip further, according to AAA. Gasoline prices are falling fast, driven by the coronavirus pandemic and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. That means savings for drivers, but benefits might be out-shadowed by the economic costs of both the viral outbreak and the collapse of crude prices. According to AAA, gas prices hit a new low for the year at $2.30 on Friday, with the possibility that the coming weeks will see prices drop even further. That's remarkable, given that prices usually climb at this time of year. "Should trends continue the way they are, there's a possibility we could see the national average hit $2 in the next coming weeks," says AAA spokeswoman Jeanette Casselano. Prices vary by location; in Texas, the average is already under $2, while Washington, California and Hawaii are still over $3.  At a Gulf station near Alexandria, Va., most drivers were delighted with the price at the pump on Thursday: $1.81. "I was shocked," said Vickie Robinson. "I can't believe it." Gasoline prices dropped because crude oil prices have crashed recently. Demand declined as people around the world stay home to avoid spreading the coronavirus; then prices dropped further and supply spiked because of a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. Those factors were weighing heavily on Mani Younas when he pulled in to the same pump as Robinson. He, too, couldn't believe the low gas prices, but he worried it was a bad sign for the U.S. economy. "It can be 50-cent gas, but if you don't have money to fill up, what's the point?" he asked. Cheap Saudi oil will destroy U.S. companies, he said. "It's not good for our economy." It's true that the Saudi-Russia price war is hurting oil companies around the world, including in the U.S., which is the world's largest oil and natural gas producer. Tom Kloza, an analyst with the Oil Price Information Service, says that while low gasoline prices save American drivers money, they cost American producers significantly more. "I worked out some back-of-the-envelope math and I figured that maybe in March and April of this year, we'll save about $10 billion compared to what we paid in 2018," he said. But if you add up what was lost by the oil and gas industry, as well as companies affected by oil and gas losses, in just the last week, "it is many, many times $10 billion," Kloza said. Even AAA — which usually celebrates low gas prices — noted in its most recent update that while consumers are feeling a benefit now, "sustained cheap crude prices" could contribute to a recession. Meanwhile, those low prices are a symptom of all the things that have slowed down or stopped because of this pandemic, as schools, factories and conferences have shut down. And that's bad news for all kinds of businesses and their employees. If you've lost income, cheaper gas might be welcome. But if you're no longer commuting or traveling, it might be a moot point. Wilson Garcia, at the gas station near Alexandria, was initially very happy with the cheap prices. "Seeing it under $2 is amazing," he says. "I haven't seen it that low in a long time." But he works at a hotel, and the travel and hospitality industry has been hit hard by the pandemic as people cancel travel plans. This week, his hours were cut from 40 to 24. When he found out the pandemic also contributed to the low gas prices, he reassessed. The savings, he said, were "bittersweet."

 The stock market rebounded Friday after cratering on fears over the coronavirus pandemic. Updated at 4:18 p.m. ET It was a lucky Friday the 13th for Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 1,985 points, more than 9%, on the same day President Trump declared a national emergency to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. It closed at 23,185. The S&P 500 index also jumped more than 9%, closing at 2,711. The rebound comes just one day after the blue chip stock index posted its biggest drop since the Black Monday crash of 1987.  Trump said the emergency declaration would free up as much as $50 billion for state and local governments to deal with the coronavirus. He also asked every state to set up emergency operations centers.  Investors are hopeful as Congress appears to be getting closer to passing a measure to help cushion the blow of the coronavirus pandemic, which has jammed up or shut down many parts of the U.S. economy. The European Commission announced several economic measures as well.  And the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are taking aggressive steps to help banks and other businesses.  The Trump administration announced a series of measures intended to speed up testing for the coronavirus disease COVID-19.  On Thursday, the Dow fell 2,352 points, or about 10% — its biggest one-day drop since the Black Monday crash of October 1987. Major stock indexes are down at least 20% from their recent record highs, which puts the in bear market territory after an 11-year winning streak. The Dow has fallen nearly 6,400 points since Feb. 12.

Stocks Enter Bear Market. What Does It Mean?,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/12/815090982/stocks-enter-bear-market-what-does-it-mean,March 12, 2020, Nothing lasts forever — not even a stock market that keeps going up, up and up. This week, just days after its 11-year anniversary, investors unceremoniously said goodbye to the longest-running bull market in history.  Then the bears took over.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average entered bear market territory when it tumbled more than 20% from the record it had just set on Feb. 12. And, as of  Thursday, the blue chip index was down nearly 8,400 points — a stunning 28% — from that high point. A bear market is defined as a period in which the major stock indexes drop by 20% or more from a recent high point and remain that low for at least a few months. The two worst bear markets in history — during the Great Depression and the Great Recession — produced cumulative losses of 83% and 51%, respectively. Analysts like to say that the stock market is not the economy. But a bear market reflects concerns and anxieties about the economy, and at times a bear market is accompanied by a recession. A recession is when the economy experiences two or more consecutive quarters of decline. As to the origin of bulls and bears when referring to the market, Invesopedia says: "Historically, the middlemen in the sale of bearskins would sell skins they had yet to receive. As such, they would speculate on the future purchase price of these skins from the trappers, hoping they would drop. The trappers would profit from a spread — the difference between the cost price and the selling price. These middlemen became known as 'bears', short for bearskin jobbers, and the term stuck for describing a downturn in the market. Conversely, because bears and bulls were widely considered to be opposites due to the once-popular blood sport of bull-and-bear fights, the term bull stands as the opposite of bears." 
Healthcare And Economic Despair,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/12/815128921/healthcare-and-economic-despair,March 12, 2020, Americans spend way more on healthcare than people in other similarly rich countries. In fact, if the U.S. spent as much as the Swiss, who are number two in the world healthcare expense rankings — the amount of money left over would represent $8,300 per family. And guess what? The average Swiss person lives five years longer than the average American. So it's not as if we're getting a bargain for our money.  Our costs of care are high for a variety of reasons: drugs, doctors salaries; higher education, etc. And the direct economic impact of the high cost of healthcare is quite well understood — less affordability. What's less understood is the extent of the indirect damage that those high costs can have. That's things like the contribution to inequality, to outsourcing by companies and the decline in jobs that come with healthcare coverage. Anne Case, Professor of economics at Princeton, looks at these hidden economic effects in the book she co-authored, Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism. We spoke to her about her findings, and why she calls high healthcare costs a cancer on the American economy. Music by Drop Electric. Find us: Twitter / Facebook / Newsletter.

 The elbow bump has replaced the handshake in many situations, including this greeting between Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte (right) and Dutch Minister for Medical Care Bruno Bruins in The Hague, Netherlands, on Tuesday. The handshake, a staple of business meetings, is under siege. The coronavirus is reshaping social and workplace norms, so keeping one's distance is now the polite thing to do.   Mike Sandifer, a Realtor based in Bethesda, Md., is practicing this new, emerging etiquette. He typically offers an "elbow bump," nudging people gently with his arm. But Sandifer has to fight the deeply ingrained instinct to extend his hand. "You know, people from the South are kind of touchy-feely. That's sort of our nature," he says. Plus, he's in real estate. "We are a handshaking crowd." Hand-washing has become a global obsession, reminding Sandifer of his mother constantly telling him to sing the ABC's while doing so to ensure they were sufficiently cleansed. Virus and disease shaped Sandifer's childhood. In the 1960s, his father tended to polio patients in iron lungs, and his mother always wore gloves — for fashion, but also for hygiene. Now, everyone's preaching hand hygiene. And that's made the handshake taboo. England's Premier League has banned them during soccer matches. German Prime Minister Angela Merkel was left hanging after her interior minister denied her outstretched hand. This week, the Dutch prime minister announced a no-handshake rule, then promptly turned and shook a health official's hand. He then apologized. So what replaces the handshake? That's up for grabs, so to speak. There's the fist bump. Or the elbow bump. Or a prayer gesture, which Sandifer likes. "The namaste is sort of a nice ... . I think that that's multicultural," he says. Asian cultures — which typically bow instead of handshake — also strike a humble and nice tone, he says. But the lack of consensus has made greeting people bewildering and, frankly, a bit awkward, and etiquette experts agree. Thomas Farley, a New York-based etiquette consultant, says he saw this in full effect over the weekend, when he attended several hands-free greetings, including a birthday party where the host posted a sign reading: "This is a hug and kiss-free zone."  That was a coronavirus first for Farley. "What I liked about it, honestly, was it took some of the awkwardness out of it so that the ground rules were there so that everybody could not feel like the bad person," he says.  At another party later that same day, people traded elbow bumps and foot shakes — known also as "the Wuhan shake," after the virus's epicenter. That was weird, Farley says, because this was a house where shoes are left at the door. "That made foot-to-foot contact a little bit perhaps more intimate than might be if you were actually wearing shoes," he says. The coronavirus culture is now forcing Farley to rethink how he teaches business etiquette. One core element had been the perfect handshake: Not flimsy — but not a death grip — and certainly not clammy. "Now, of course, we're suddenly thrust into this new era," he says, although  even the new era has its limits for Farley. "To elbow bump or chest bump. It's just ... it's not professional," he says in a tone tinged with disdain.  His personal preference? "As a Star Trek fan, I love the 'live long and prosper' greeting with the split fingers."
Princess Cruises To Pause Trips For The Next Two Months Due To Pandemic,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/12/814912773/princess-cruises-to-pause-trips-for-the-next-two-months-due-to-pandemic,March 12, 2020,

 Two Princess cruise ships, including the Diamond Princess, have faced high-profile difficulties because of the spread of the coronavirus. Thousands of people have been facing a difficult decision in recent weeks about whether to cancel or postpone an upcoming cruise vacation amid the global coronavirus pandemic. Now, for many, the decision has been made for them. Princess Cruises announced Thursday that it is voluntarily pausing its cruise operations for the next two months starting immediately. And Viking Cruises made a similar announcement on Wednesday, saying it would stop cruises from embarking through the end of April. Both are offering refunds, or credit, for future cruises. "In the interest of doing what's right and upholding our core values, I am regretfully announcing a 60 day pause of our Princess global ship operations," said Princess Cruises President Jan Swartz. "This is perhaps the most difficult decision in our history." Two Princess cruises have faced high-profile difficulties because of the spread of the virus. Last month, the Diamond Princess was held in port in Yokohama, Japan for weeks under a quarantine, and nearly 700 tested positive for the virus. As NPR's Bill Chappell noted, "the quarantine has been heavily criticized for failing to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 among passengers and crew." Earlier this week, the Grand Princess cruise ship docked in Oakland, Calif., after spending several days off the California coast. More than 20 passengers tested positive for the virus. The first person to die in California was traced to the Grand Princess. Viking Cruises has also had to quarantine passengers who may have been exposed, but it did not say that any of them have tested positive. Princess Cruises says it serves more than 50,000 people every day from 70 countries on its 18 cruise ships. "Perhaps the diverse mix of people on board our ships is reflecting what is going on in communities around the world," said the company's president Jan Swartz. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has discouraged people with underlying conditions from going on cruises. "You don't travel. You don't go to very crowded places," he told NPR. "Particularly, you don't get on a cruise ship because of what we've seen what happened with a cruise ship. That's protecting the vulnerable." The State Department has also discouraged all U.S. citizens from traveling by cruise ship, noting that health officials have noted the "increased risk of infection of COVID-19 in a cruise ship environment." Princess Cruises says that passengers now on cruises that are set to end in five days or less will finish the trips without changing the itinerary. Cruises that end after that time period "will be ended at the most convenient location for guests, factoring in operational requirements," the company says. As NPR's Chris Arnold has noted, cruise industry trade group Cruise Lines International Association said earlier this week that its member companies are adopting additional screening measures because of the virus. Those include denying boarding to passengers coming in the last 14 days from countries with outbreaks such as South Korea, Iran, China, and parts of Italy. The trade group also called for its members to take the temperatures of all people aboard before the start of the cruise and provide additional medical assessment to anyone with a temperature at 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or above.

 After weeks of turmoil over the economic toll of the coronavirus, U.S. stock indexes entered a bear market, signaling an end to their 11-year winning streak. Updated at 4:04 p.m. ET The stock market has suffered a relentless, breathtaking drop — moving deeper into bear territory. Stocks fell so fast Thursday morning that it triggered a 15-minute halt in trading for the second time this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2,352 points, or nearly 10% — the biggest one-day drop since 1987. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were each down more than 9%. Those indexes are now down at least 27% from record highs set just last month. The Dow is now down nearly 8,400 points from its peak on Feb. 12. Thursday's stock market drop followed a nearly 6% plunge in the Dow on Wednesday, when the blue chip index entered a bear market, defined as falling 20% from its peak. The S&P 500 is now also in a bear market, ending an 11-year winning streak. The market tumble came after President Trump announced a 30-day travel ban on visitors from European countries (not including the United Kingdom) to the United States. Trump said it was an effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus, but the move caused confusion on both sides of the Atlantic and drew skepticism from several health experts. And it was also another blow to airlines, hotels and tourist attractions that have already taken a beating. In remarks to reporters, Trump tried to calm markets, predicting stocks would eventually bounce back. The Federal Reserve moved aggressively to try to calm investors rattled by the global coronavirus pandemic, but then the market slide continued. The New York Fed said it would pump $1.5 trillion into short-term funding markets over the next two days. "These changes are being made to address highly unusual disruptions in Treasury financing markets associated with the coronavirus outbreak," the New York Fed said. Last week, the Fed cut interest rates by half a percentage point in an emergency move. Some analysts expect the central bank to cut rates again at its March 18 meeting, if not sooner. Those rates affect the cost of borrowing on everything from credit cards to auto loans. In addition to the travel ban, Trump also announced measures to overcome "temporary economic disruptions" caused by the COVID-19 disease. The proposals include a $50 billion program to provide low-interest loans to small businesses affected by the coronavirus. Congressional Democrats also unveiled a legislative stimulus package aimed at easing the economic damage. Their plan includes expanded unemployment reimbursement for states, extra money for food security for low-income children and federally funded family and sick leave for people affected by the virus. The coronavirus pandemic has had far-reaching and quickly developing economic impacts. Thursday morning, Princess Cruises, which has had several ships hit by coronavirus outbreaks, announced that it will pause operations of its 18 cruise ships globally for 60 days. The move is in response "to the unpredictable circumstances evolving from the global spread of COVID-19," the company said. The airline industry has also been hard hit by travel cancellations and travel restrictions. "I would say we're in the middle of a very significant impact, some would say devastating impact, to the airline industry," JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes told NPR. The NBA suspended the rest of its season after a player on the Utah Jazz preliminarily tested positive for the coronavirus. Major League Baseball canceled the remainder of spring training and said it would delay the start of the regular season by at least two weeks. The National Hockey League also announced a "pause" in its season. And the NCAA canceled its Division I men's and women's college basketball tournaments, known as March Madness.  In New York, Broadway theaters were shut down after Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced restrictions on gatherings of more than 500 people. The European Central Bank announced a series of stimulus measures to help banks and other businesses. But unlike the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, the ECB failed to cut interest rates. "The spread of the coronavirus has been a major shock to the growth prospects of the global economy and the euro area economy, and it has heightened market volatility," ECB President Christine Lagarde told a news conference, according to Reuters.

 The New York Times' exposé of star litigator David Boies' efforts against Jeffrey Epstein's estate and social circle took inspiration from a source who appears to have lied. Did the reporting hold up? The intriguing tale began in mid-September with an invitation for two New York Times reporters to come to the Midtown Manhattan offices of the legendary lawyer David Boies for an off-the-record session. The two reporters — Jake Bernstein and Emily Steel — were asked to leave their phones and laptops outside the conference room. No taping. The guest of honor: a hard-drinking, burly man who promised that he could link powerful politicians and globe-trotting luminaries to the late Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and sexual predator. Boies and another lawyer for Epstein accusers introduced the reporters to the apparent informant. The man went by a pseudonym, Patrick Kessler, saying he feared retribution. He boasted about damning videos of prominent men at Epstein's properties. And Kessler showed the reporters, as he had the lawyers, blurry stills of what he said were men having sex with women and girls. He claimed the men were in the top echelons of politics, finance and law. He promised proof. But the informant appears to have been a fraud. And he has since vanished. Even so, he inspired an investigation by the Times not of Epstein, but of one of the country's most famous lawyers. In a 5,400-word expose published on Nov. 30 and an hourlong television show, the Times placed Boies at the center of a narrative that insinuates deceit and greed inside a morally corrupt legal system. The story, the result of months of reporting by a team of four Times journalists, promised to reveal how even the lawyers representing alleged victims of sexual predators seek paydays in ways that enable powerful men to avoid accountability. Boies says the Times account is terribly unfair. "I didn't do anything deceitful here, and there's no basis for that allegation," Boies tells NPR in December. "For them to put that in the article that is about me, without making clear that they're not making that allegation about me, it is, I think, quite misleading." To this day, it remains unclear what the newspaper's reporting uncovered. Boies' own actions on other matters had already tarnished his reputation. But the Times journalists acknowledge they didn't have evidence that proved Boies either acted wrongfully or intended to profit from the Epstein cases. And their chief informant for the story had lied repeatedly, the Times itself concluded. * * * Epstein was arrested last July on sex trafficking charges. A month later, he was found dead in his jail cell in what has been ruled a suicide. In August, the man calling himself Patrick Kessler approached The Winchester Star in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley with the same story about Epstein's powerful friends. As captured on an audio recording, one of the Winchester reporters asked Kessler why he didn't seek out a national news outlet. Kessler said he trusted the Star because he had grown up nearby. Reporters there soon questioned his veracity. The Star spoke to a lawyer whom Kessler claimed to have consulted. He said he hadn't heard of Kessler. "When he did not show up a week later, I thought, 'Well, this guy's a crackpot or, you know, a fabulist,' somebody who just likes to spin stories and just wasted our time," says Winchester Star reporter Evan Goodenow. "And so I kind of dismissed it." Just a week after that, the two Times reporters met Kessler at Boies' office. Not even an hour after the meeting, Kessler sent a text message to Times reporter Emily Steel saying that he wanted to meet again. That afternoon, at the back of a Chinese restaurant, Kessler steered the two Times reporters, Steel and Bernstein, toward what he argued was a different scandal: the behavior of the two lawyers they had just met. Kessler alleged the attorneys wanted to turn his material to their own advantage, rather than that of their clients — the women who said they had been victimized by Epstein and his social circle. This new direction appealed to the Times. Investigative reporter and one of the four journalists on the story Jessica Silver-Greenberg tells NPR that she had been seeking a window into "the universe of people, powerful men, that had potentially enabled Epstein and allowed him to continue to allegedly abuse women for decades." Lawyers had helped to shield Epstein, Silver-Greenberg says, creating a financial model in which they could secure big payouts for accusers and fees for themselves from the prominent men their clients accused — but let those men keep their actions secret. It reminded her of nondisclosure agreements in settlements of harassment claims against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Women were paid but had to keep silent, keeping the pattern of his behavior from public view. Lawyers struck similar deals for accusations against the late Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly, now both gone from Fox News. (Ailes, Weinstein and O'Reilly all denied those allegations.) The Times reported extensively on them all, helping to usher in the #MeToo movement. Nondisclosure pacts are legal and even common in corporate life. Some attorneys for alleged victims say clients seek to avoid public glare. Yet NDAs are increasingly under attack. Most recently, now-former presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg announced he would release three women who filed complaints against him at Bloomberg LP from confidentiality clauses after rivals blasted him for it at a Democratic presidential debate. "I had been looking at all this huge network of lawyers," Silver-Greenberg tells NPR, "not only in the defense attorneys who were representing Epstein, but also the attorneys that had represented the victims." Boies stood out. He was a towering figure with an illustrious record as a litigator. He had argued the government's antitrust case against Microsoft a generation ago. He was Al Gore's go-to attorney in the 2000 election recount debacle. Boies helped persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to legalize gay marriage. Boies also caught their attention because he represented the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, accused of sexual assault or harassment by 100 women. Weinstein was convicted last month of felony sex crime and rape and sentenced Wednesday to 23 years in prison. In Epstein's case, Boies Schiller represents several women with claims against the financier's estate and friends. In that first meeting with the Times reporters, a second lawyer was present, by the name of Stan Pottinger. Pottinger would play an essential role in the Times' tale. He and Boies are friends; their unrelated firms represent different clients with similar accusations against Epstein and his associates. (Pottinger did not return four messages from NPR seeking comment.) Though he is not nearly as prominent as Boies, Pottinger was a Justice Department official under President Ford and dated Gloria Steinem in the 1970s and 1980s. He is now at Edwards Pottinger. Kessler promised the reporters a window into how the lawyers operated. Kessler shared with the Times texts that Pottinger had sent in which he had drawn up a "hot list" of prominent men as possible targets. Boies was not copied on the exchanges. The Times wrote, "It seemed [to Kessler] like Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger were plotting to use his footage to demand huge sums from billionaires. He said it looked like blackmail." Pottinger suggested in his texts that lawyers could make up to 40% of the money they negotiated in private settlements. Pottinger confirmed the texts were authentic, the paper reported. Pottinger said he had been deceiving Kessler to get him to share what videos and other documentation he had against Epstein's friends. Pottinger also told the paper he informed the FBI and a federal prosecutor about the material Kessler claimed to have. Emails between Boies and Times reporters show him wrestling over whether to trust Kessler, hoping but not certain the informant was real. The Times concluded that Boies had outsourced his relationship with Kessler to Pottinger and that the lawyers were working in concert. The Times used Kessler's communications with Pottinger to convey a story of hypocrisy and greed about Boies as well. * * * Here's the defining passage of the article: "Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger would go from toasting Kessler as their 'whistle-blower' and 'informant' to torching him as a 'fraudster' and a 'spy.' "Kessler was a liar, and he wouldn't expose any sexual abuse.  "But he would reveal something else: The extraordinary, at times deceitful measures elite lawyers deployed in an effort to get evidence that could be used to win lucrative settlements — and keep misconduct hidden, allowing perpetrators to abuse again. "Mr. Boies has publicly decried such deals as 'rich man's justice,' a way that powerful men buy their way out of legal and reputational jeopardy. This is how it works." David Enrich, a Times business editor who helped to report the story, tells NPR, "Our obligation is to be truthful and as transparent as possible and to tell the truth to our readers as best we can." In November, video cameras captured a tense moment for the Times television show The Weekly. Reporter Silver-Greenberg and Enrich confronted Boies with the encrypted texts between Pottinger and Kessler, prompted by Kessler's questions of how they could make money. In their joint interview with NPR, the two Times journalists say they believe Boies was genuinely aghast at the texts they showed him. "He was visibly surprised to see them and I think visibly upset to see them," Enrich tells NPR. "So I don't think he knew. ... He said that he did not intend to do what Stan Pottinger says they were discussing doing. And I can give him the benefit of the doubt on that. " The Times article nonetheless suggests Boies was a willing part of a larger effort to extract large sums of money in settlements from powerful men. "What I think is not fair journalism is to somehow imply I was involved in what was being discussed when the Times knows, and has acknowledged, that I didn't even know about those text messages until they showed them to me," Boies tells NPR. He says he is being tarred by the newspaper's conclusions over his friend's texts. "I didn't participate in them. I didn't know about them at the time that they were done," Boies says. He says his retention agreements with Epstein's accusers allow him only to recoup costs and expenses, not fees from such settlements. NPR has reviewed the agreements, confirmed also by one of his clients. A foundation Boies discussed with Enrich would not have benefited him, Boies says. "As the Times knows, we were not going to make any money out of these cases," Boies says. The Times team does not fundamentally dispute that contention; its article noted in passing that Boies was working pro bono — without payment. Even so, Enrich and Silver-Greenberg argue Boies remains a key player. "I don't think it matters whether or not David Boies is going to get rich off these settlements," Silver-Greenberg says. "Burying that information [of sexual assault or misconduct], making it disappear, and letting some of the world's richest, most powerful men off the hook through these legal settlements is the issue." * * * Though Boies had built up a distinguished legal record stretching back more than a half-century, he damaged that reputation badly in two recent episodes, one of which involved the Times directly. Boies earned sharp criticism for his close ties to Theranos, a blood testing startup that collapsed under accusations of fraud. Its founder now faces federal criminal charges. Boies served as an outside lawyer and a corporate director. The former Wall Street Journal reporter who exposed the fraud, John Carreyrou, has said Boies' firm acted to intimidate whistleblowers. Boies denies that. In recent years, Boies' firm did legal defense work for the Times. Then, in late 2017, the newspaper fired Boies Schiller Flexner over revelations he hired a private firm run by former Israeli spies for Harvey Weinstein. As The New Yorker first reported, that firm sought to intimidate the Times' sources and even tailed its reporters. Boies says he was unaware of the extent of the firm's work. The Times implied Boies took on the Epstein cases to help restore his reputation: "By 2019, Mr. Boies, 78, was representing a number of Mr. Epstein's alleged victims." Boies says he represented his first alleged Epstein victim in 2015, before Theranos became a scandal, and added others subsequently. "I think it's fair to say that [Boies'] representation of Epstein victims has helped him burnish his reputation when he needed it the most," Silver-Greenberg says. * * * The Times has its own checkered backstory in covering Epstein. Epstein was first convicted in a Florida state court of a sex crime involving a minor in 2008. After his release from prison, Epstein still held significant sway in New York City, hosting titans of finance, politics, media, academia and high society. He hosted parties at a townhouse that was reportedly the largest in Manhattan. Even so, the Times wrote about Epstein sparingly, and, when it did, even admiringly. One financial reporter who kept tabs on Epstein for the Times wrote a gauzy profile of him that ran just before Epstein was set to enter prison in 2008. Reporter Landon Thomas Jr. mostly portrayed the offense as patronizing prostitutes rather than highlighting it as a crime involving a minor. In the summer of 2018, Thomas refused an assignment to call Epstein on a story, citing a conflict. At his request, the financier had made a $30,000 donation to a Harlem cultural center. Enrich, Thomas' editor, ordered him not to write about Epstein again. Thomas was forced to leave the paper at the start of 2019. Enrich says the Times should have told readers about the episode, which the paper has never done. The Miami Herald's Julie K. Brown broke the story open in November 2018 by chronicling accusations against Epstein and the failures of major institutions to hold him accountable. Brown says the press is among those institutions. Boies cites the press' failings too. "We filed our first [Epstein] case in 2015. We filed a second case in 2016. And in 2016 we tried to get the Times to write about this," Boies says. "Until July [2019], the Times showed no interest at all in Epstein's victims or in the scope and scale of Epstein's sex trafficking, or even in the fact that the sex trafficking was going on." Enrich doesn't flinch at the criticism. "I think that we missed the ball on the Epstein coverage," says Enrich, who joined the paper in 2017 and is now its business investigations editor. "I am really disappointed in myself and The New York Times for not having responded as forcefully and as quickly and as aggressively as we should have." The Times intensified its Epstein coverage after a grand jury handed up indictments against him on more serious charges of sex crimes against minors last summer. The Times was also slow to cover developments involving Joichi Ito, then director of the MIT Media Lab. Ito resigned from the New York Times Co. board and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last September as his ties to Epstein came into focus. Ito had solicited contributions for the lab and his own venture fund from Epstein years after the financier's conviction for crimes involving sex with underage teenagers. The Times journalists wrote that their report lays bare how "powerful men buy their way out of legal and reputational jeopardy." And in interviews, they say their reporting did so in a transparent way, acknowledging false starts and unanswered questions. Their lengthy interview with NPR about the story is part of that transparency, they say. "This is one of the pieces of journalism — both The Weekly [television show] and the article — that I'm most proud of," Silver-Greenberg says. "And I'm proud of us for showing our process in this." * * * And what about the man who called himself Patrick Kessler? He told the lawyers and the Times reporters that he had material implicating former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Britain's Prince Andrew and Harvard Law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz, who had been a legal adviser for Epstein and served on President Trump's legal team during the Senate impeachment trial. (All have denied any impropriety.) Times reporters spoke with Kessler repeatedly. One session stretched over eight hours at a Washington hotel conference room and involved two bottles of Japanese whisky, according to the paper. The Times sought without luck to substantiate Kessler's claims last fall; online searches easily pulled up his supposedly classified documents; a coffee company denied any knowledge of him as an investor; he frequently contradicted his own assertions. (NPR unsuccessfully sought to reach Kessler on a mobile phone number he had used in the past. A message left with a man who said he knew him was not returned.) Most important, Kessler failed to deliver any proof of his claims. On the Times show The Weekly, business editor Ellen Pollock describes awaiting delivery of Epstein's computer servers in October from Iceland. The grandiose promise collapsed with Kessler texting about a fire, a missing team member and his own desperate flight to Kyiv. The Times team never saw Kessler again. "He didn't even ask for money to be fronted to him," Boies says. "When you conclude a fraud has been committed, the question is, why? He's unlikely to be doing that entirely on his own." The Times article contains the hint of a question: Was he sent to discredit Boies and Pottinger? And by whom? The Times' Enrich says the paper's reporters continuously hunted Kessler — even after publishing. What was he? A scam artist? An extortionist? A plant? They don't know. "There is not a day in those three months, including weekends, that we were not trying to figure out who Patrick Kessler is, what he actually has, where he comes from, why he's doing this," Enrich says. The Times journalists say they never thought to wait to publish until they unraveled the secret of Patrick Kessler. They tenaciously held onto the story they sought to tell, as twisty as it turned out to be, alerted to the path by a patently unreliable guide.
Episode 978: Coronavirus, Oil, and Kansas,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/11/814529252/episode-978-coronavirus-oil-and-kansas,March 11, 2020, OPEC started in the 1960s when a bunch of oil-exporting countries got together and asked themselves: Why are we all competing with each other? Why don't we just carve up the market and let the profits roll in? So they formed a cartel. And it had been working pretty well — until this weekend, when something went horribly wrong for the cartel, and the price of oil fell almost 25%. In this episode, we follow the plunge in oil prices from the viral outbreak in China, to a secret meeting in Vienna, to one guy who runs a little mom-and-pop oil business in Kansas — all to find out why this happened, and what exactly this price crash means.

 Laurence Fishburne as Dr. Ellis Cheever and Kate Winslet as Dr. Erin Mears in the thriller Contagion. Winslet's character was modeled on CDC epidemiologist Dr. Anne Schuchat. Note: A version of this story first ran on February 7, 2019 It's official: COVID-19 is a pandemic. The World Health Organization made that announcement today. It reminded us of a conversation we had last year with  Dr. Anne Schuchat — the deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — about an elite unit within the CDC that is focused on pandemics, and how to keep them in check. This special team of epidemiologists is called the Epidemic Intelligence Service, also known by their snappier title: The Disease Detectives. Dr. Schuchat was a disease detective during the SARS outbreak in 2003. We talked to her about the work of the EIS, the risk of global pandemics, and what keeps her up at night.

 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and fellow Democrats hold a news conference to discuss emergency paid sick leave to assist people whose jobs are impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. Updated at 11:32 p.m. ET Congressional Democrats unveiled a measure for a legislative stimulus package aimed at mitigating the economic damage stemming from the coronavirus. The House legislation, which was released shortly after 11 p.m. on Wednesday, provides short-term benefits including expanded unemployment reimbursement for states, additional funding for food security for low-income children and federally funded family and sick leave for people affected by the virus. In addition to the paid leave programs, the legislation would provide $500 million for low-income women, mothers with young children and pregnant women who lose jobs due to the virus, $400 million for food banks and flexibility for state-run programs. The bill also includes free coronavirus testing and a boost in Medicaid reimbursement to help states address testing and treatment needs. The White House position on the measure is unclear.  The Democratic measure came shortly after President Trump addressed the nation and unveiled his plan to stem coronavirus: a 30-day suspension of travel from Europe to the U.S. and a raft of economic measures.  Trump had previously proposed a payroll tax cut to boost the economy, but both House and Senate Democrats rejected that proposal, arguing it does not provide help to those hit hardest by the pandemic. They said that tax relief is geared too much toward wealthier Americans who aren't feeling the pain as acutely as restaurant, hotel and others in the retail sector. "We need targeted assistance to those workers and families who are being directly affected by the coronoavirus," Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said. Trump's advisers have recommended economic measures he can take using his executive powers — and some that he will need to work with Congress on to help small- and medium-sized business, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said, speaking at a White House meeting with CEOs from major banks.  "I think the financial system of the US is in great shape and is prepared to handle this problem" Mnuchin said.  House Democratic leaders outlined their legislation to rank and file members at a closed-door meeting Wednesday afternoon. The plan includes federally funded paid sick and family leave, an expansion of food security benefits for low-income families and other proposals to encourage people with symptoms to come forward and be tested, according to several Democrats in the meeting.  House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., told reporters he worked on a portion of the bill that would expand unemployment insurance to provide reimbursement to states.  "We are acting on a national health emergency," Neal said. "This will encourage people to go and get tested." Neal said he has been in touch with Mnuchin throughout the drafting of the legislation and "he surely seemed supportive of the positions I had taken." Mnuchin has also been in frequent contact with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., according to leadership aides.  Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, tweeted that the speaker conferred with Mnuchin shortly before she briefed Democrats on the legislation. A second call (this one at the Speaker’s request) occurred at 4:07 p.m. for approximately 10 minutes. https://t.co/XiduPDV14V House Democrats plan to move quickly once the legislative text is released. House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., told reporters that he is on call to process the legislation with the goal of holding a vote on Thursday.  Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., began pushing over the weekend for many of the items in the new bill. Schumer emphasized in a press conference on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that their framework for a legislative response must included items like paid family leave, nutrition assistance and other proposals he said would help give both short-and long-term relief.  Trump said in the meeting with banking industry leaders that he was looking at "various forms" of economic stimulus, but noted that Democrats were not in favor of a payroll tax holiday.  Earler on Wednesday Schumer sent a letter to the president along with more than 30 Senate Democrats appealing for quick action. "While following social distancing guidelines may be important to mitigate the spread of the virus, it creates potentially grave economic challenges for American workers who are not easily able to telework or who do not have access to paid leave," the senators wrote. "Further limitations on travel, access to more common general services, and cancellation of major events will potentially hurt a large number of Americans who work or depend upon hospitality, travel, tourism, and retail businesses." They also pressed for six months of loan forgiveness for federal student loans and mortgages, disaster grants for communities forced to shut down, direct assistance from the Small Business Administration for retail and other businesses failing due to drop off because of the outbreak. "The virus doesn't say are you a Republican or a Democrat," Democratic Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy said Wednesday, adding, "It's affecting all Americans."
PepsiCo Seeks Boost In Energy Drink Market With Purchase Of Rockstar,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/11/814462332/pepsico-seeks-boost-in-energy-drink-market-with-purchase-of-rockstar,March 11, 2020,

 PepsiCo is seeking to expand its market share in the energy drink category by acquiring Rockstar Energy Beverages. Beverage giant PepsiCo, Inc. has agreed to purchase energy drink maker  Rockstar Energy Beverages for $3.85 billion dollars, the company announced Wednesday. It's a move PepsiCo said will help it become "more consumer-centric and capitalize on rising demand."  Energy drinks have been a relatively weak area for PepsiCo and its rival Coca-Cola, but both companies have trying to bolster their presence in the fast-expanding beverage category.   The move also reflects the shifting tastes as consumers have steadily weaned themselves from soda to other offerings that also include coffee and tea-flavored beverages and low-calorie drinks.  Though sometimes confused with or lumped into the beverage category that includes sports beverages, energy drinks are considered a different product.  "They are marketed to increase alertness and energy levels, containing significant amounts of caffeine and as much or more sugar as in soda. Many energy drinks pack about 200 mg of caffeine, the amount in two cups of brewed coffee," according to Harvard's The Nutrition Source website.  As the market for energy drinks grows, companies like PepsiCo, which already had a distribution deal with Rockstar in North America, are seeking capitalize on that demand. "Over time, we expect to capture our fair share of this fast-growing, highly profitable category and create meaningful new partnerships in the energy space," PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a statement.   Russ Weiner, Rockstar's founder, added that he was excited to take the PepsiCo-Rockstar relationship "to the next level."  "PepsiCo shares our competitive spirit and will invest in growing our brand even further. I'm proud of what we built and how we've changed the game in the energy space," Weiner said.   PepsiCo's portfolio of energy drinks already includes Mountain Dew's AMP and Game Fuel. Another drink listed under juice beverages includes Mountain Dew Kickstart. Coca-Cola's portfolio includes a stake in energy giant Monster as well as Coca-Cola Energy, which it began selling in the U.S. this year,  according to a company press release.  As the Wall Street Journal points out, the PepsiCo-Rockstar deal has not yet closed, but if it does, it will be the first big acquisition Pepsi has made since 2018 when it acquired the seltzer-maker SodaStream.  It also represents the first major deal under Laguarta, who took over as PepsiCo's top executive after his predecessor, Indra Nooyi, stepped down in 2018. She led the company for 12 years.

 The stock market has continued to be volatile in recent weeks over growing fears that the spread of coronavirus will push the world economy into recession. Updated at 5:18 p.m. ET Major stock indexes plunged again on Wednesday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 20% from its peak in February. The meant that the blue chip index entered bear market territory, ending its 11-year winning streak. The blue chip index fell 1,464 points, or nearly 5.9%. The S&P 500 slid 4.9% and the Nasdaq lost 4.7% — and put those indexes down 19.2% from their peaks.  Just on Monday, the stock market had its worst drop since 2008 amid fears that the growing spread of coronavirus would push the global economy into recession. Early Wednesday afternoon, the World Health Organization declared that the disease COVID-19, caused by coronavirus, is a pandemic. As of Tuesday, the WHO was reporting about 120,000 cases in 114 countries on six continents.  President Trump told reporters he will be making a statement about coronavirus Wednesday night. He made the comments as he met with the chief executives of major banks.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told House lawmakers the administration is considering several ways to help businesses affected by coronavirus-related disruptions. "There are a large number of workers that are going to be required to self-quarantine or be at home to take care of family members who are self-quarantined," he said. "For small and medium-sized businesses, we think it's appropriate for the government to pick up those costs." Mnuchin said officials are also considering extending deadlines for tax payments for individuals and small businesses. And he said the administration is considering giving federal loan guarantees to some industries that are "highly impacted by travel."  The airline industry has been one of the hardest hit by the coronavirus, as people and businesses cancel travel plans. In an interview with NPR's Peter O'Dowd on Wednesday, JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes compared the impact to the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. "I would say we're in the middle of a very significant impact, some would say devastating impact, to the airline industry," Hayes said. "There were lots of concerns just after 9/11 about flying. And we're really seeing the same now with the coronavirus." But, he said, the industry is better able to withstand the economic shock than it was during the 2008 financial crisis. "It's pretty healthy. We've all built stronger balance sheets. We've all got good liquidity. And so I think the economic backdrop for airlines is very different," Hayes said. The Federal Reserve and other central banks have been cutting interest rates, and the U.S. and other governments have been rolling out aid and stimulus proposals to help cushion the economic blow of the outbreak.  The Bank of England was the latest central bank to lower rates, announcing an emergency 0.5-percentage-point cut on Wednesday. It said the cut "will help to support business and consumer confidence at a difficult time, to bolster the cash flows of businesses and households, and to reduce the cost, and to improve the availability, of finance." Oil prices, which can reflect economic demand, have also been volatile after Saudi Arabia unexpectedly decided to slash its prices for crude last weekend. The price of oil fell 3.6% Wednesday. It has dropped 29% over the past five trading days.
Ditching A Dream Cruise Vacation Is Painful Call,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/11/814353639/cruise-industry-hit-hard-by-coronavirus-outbreak-effects,March 11, 2020,

 Linda Nalbandian and her children on a previous cruise. The family has struggled to decide whether to cancel an upcoming vacation in April. Linda Nalbandian is set to go on a cruise to Bermuda in April. Recently married, she and her husband are planning to take their five teenagers on their combined family's first big trip together.  The kids were "super excited," she says. "It was a lot of buildup over the last couple of months, talking about it, planning it, and then coronavirus." The $6,000 trip was a big expense. So as the coronavirus outbreak spreads around the world, the family's been grappling with what to do. They didn't want to wreck a great vacation if the odds were really small that there'd actually be a problem on their cruise.  "Are you being a bad parent because you're you're buying into panic or hysteria?" Nalbandian says. "Or are you being a bad parent because you're bringing them to a situation that maybe in retrospect could be like, what was I thinking?" But now many cruise ship companies are trying to reassure customers that they don't need to panic and cancel now. Customers can wait and see what happens with the outbreak and can even cancel just a few days before their cruise and get credit for another trip later. Nalbandian got an email from Norwegian Cruise Line this past weekend explaining she can cancel up to 48 hours before her trip and get a full refund in the form of a credit toward a future trip.  "It was a relief ," she says, "and it definitely left us with a warm and fuzzy feeling toward the cruise line."   
                Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said elderly people and people with underlying health problems should take special precautions and not  travel on cruise ships.

 Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said elderly people and people with underlying health problems should take special precautions and not  travel on cruise ships. She says their plan now is to wait until a couple of weeks before the cruise and decide then. Each cruise line company's policies can be different, so anyone who has booked a trip should call or go to the company's website to find out the details. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NPR this week that since elderly people and people with underlying health problems are particularly vulnerable to this coronavirus, they should take special precautions. "You don't travel, you don't go to very crowded places, particularly you don't get on a cruise ship because we've seen what happened with a cruise ship," Fauci said. What's happened so far is several ships have had outbreaks and had to quarantine passengers. Some stricken passengers died after contracting the virus.  The State Department issued this advisory Sunday: "U.S. citizens, particularly travelers with underlying health conditions, should not travel by cruise ship. CDC notes increased risk of infection of COVID-19 in a cruise ship environment. In order to curb the spread of COVID-19, many countries have implemented strict screening procedures that have denied port entry rights to ships and prevented passengers from disembarking. In some cases, local authorities have permitted disembarkation but subjected passengers to local quarantine procedures. While the U.S. government has evacuated some cruise ship passengers in recent weeks, repatriation flights should not be relied upon as an option for U.S. citizens under the potential risk of quarantine by local authorities."   Stewart Chiron, who has worked in the cruising travel industry for 30 years, says he was "very shocked and disappointed" by the government's warning.  "It's too far extreme," says Chiron, who books cruises for people through his cruiseguy.com website.  He says to warn elderly people and those with medical conditions seems reasonable. But, Chiron says, to tell everybody to stay off cruise ships goes too far. He says he'd go on a cruise today. "Right now, there are hundreds of ships sailing around the world that are not having any issues," he says. Cruise Lines International Association, the industry's trade group, says in a statement that the ships are taking special precautions — including screening people for a fever before allowing them to start a cruise, and denying boarding to anyone who has visited or traveled through airports in South Korea, Iran, China and parts of Italy. Some people are deciding the risk is worth taking. Others are canceling, or trying to. Ashley Manning, a nurse practitioner in Knoxville, Tenn., decided to cancel her cruise coming up in nine days to the Mexican Riviera on Carnival Cruise Line. "I've called Delta, I've canceled our flights," she says. "They were nonrefundable tickets. They automatically refunded everything without even a question." But she says getting through to Carnival was a different story. "I was on the phone for about three hours yesterday, kept calling, and it just never goes to anybody, just is a voice recording, and then it'll disconnect you when you think you're still on the line." Carnival says it's ramping up staffing. But as any seasoned traveler knows, when everyone calls at once it's hard to get through. So if you're going to cancel your cruise, it's probably a good idea not to leave it until the very last minute.
Tracking The Impact Of Coronavirus In Real Time,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/10/814221017/tracking-the-impact-of-coronavirus-in-real-time,March 10, 2020, A lot of people track the economy using the monthly numbers on jobs and the housing market. The only problem with most of that data is that it takes time to reflect the trends it is tracking.  And right now, everyone wants to know how the economy is being affected by COVID-19 — in real time.

 U.S. stock indexes rose nearly 5% Tuesday, after the market's worst day since 2008. What a difference a day makes. After diving more than 2,000 points Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  regained some of its footing Tuesday, rising 1,167 points. The blue chip index, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose nearly 5% after the market's worst day since 2008. The price of oil also soared, up 11% after losing 25% the day before. Tuesday's rebound was the latest move in what has been a yo-yo pattern for the stock market in the past few weeks. The jump followed President Trump's call for a payroll tax cut and other steps to help the economy amid the coronavirus epidemic.  Trump said Monday that the White House would ask Congress to pass a payroll tax cut and relief for hourly wage earners to help workers who may be feeling the financial pinch because of the outbreak.  And on Tuesday, the president said his administration was working to help the cruise and airline industries, which have been hurt by the epidemic. "We want to protect our shipping industry, our cruise industry, cruise ships," Trump said. "We want to protect our airline industry, very important. But everybody has to be vigilant and has to be careful. But be calm. It's really working out."  On Monday, the Dow fell nearly 7.8% and the S&P 500 dropped 7.6%. Stocks fell so sharply that it triggered a rare 15-minute trading halt on the New York Stock Exchange. NPR's Scott Horsley contributed to this report.

 Wells Fargo CEO and President Charles Scharf testified during a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee. Updated 4:45 p.m. ET Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer and President Charles Scharf told lawmakers Tuesday that the scandal-plagued bank he now leads "had a flawed business model" and a structure and culture that "were problematic."  He said that while he is confident that reform plans he's implementing will work, such efforts will likely continue until at least 2021.  Scharf, who was named the bank's top executive in September, was peppered with questions from members of the House Financial Services Committee for more than four hours.  Lawmakers wanted to know how he plans to steer Wells Fargo back into the public's good graces after years of cascading consumer abuse scandals.  They also pressed him on how the public could trust the financial institution, especially now, as many of its customers fear devastating economic impacts as a result of the spread of the coronavirus in the United States.  "I took this job because I believe that our country and communities benefit from a strong Wells Fargo," Scharf said in his opening statement to the committee.  He vowed to move the company in a "significantly improved direction" but also admitted: "We have not done what's necessary to address our shortcomings." Wells Fargo has been engulfed in scandals in recent years, including a $3 billion settlement last month connected to illegal sales practices. The company is still entangled in legal and financial woes stemming from a scandal that started in 2016, in which investigators found that millions of accounts were opened without customers' knowledge. 
                Scharf said that he took the job to lead the bank "because I believe that our country and communities benefit from a strong Wells Fargo."

 Scharf said that he took the job to lead the bank "because I believe that our country and communities benefit from a strong Wells Fargo." Scharf's appearance on Capitol Hill comes a day after Wells Fargo announced the resignations of two board members, including the now-former chairwoman Elizabeth Duke. She and another board member, James Quigley, said they were stepping down to "avoid distraction" and allow Scharf the "ability to turn the page." Duke and Quigley are scheduled to testify before the same committee on Wednesday. A spokesperson for Wells Fargo's board told NPR both Quigley and Duke plan to appear. The committee's Democratic majority released a report last week accusing bank executives of failing to correct deficiencies of its infrastructure and exposing customers to "countless abuses" including wrongful foreclosure. 🚨 #BREAKING: Chairwoman @RepMaxineWaters Alerts @TheJusticeDept to Inaccurate and Misleading Testimony by Tim Sloan | https://t.co/UvnR2AmxzY pic.twitter.com/DrZBSqZflG Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who chairs the committee, started the hearing by acknowledging to Scharf that the company has faced tumult in recent years.  "He is now the third Wells Fargo CEO to testify before this committee in less than three and a half years," Waters said. "I will note that each time a Wells Fargo CEO has testified before this committee he has soon resigned thereafter." After the hearing concluded, Waters sent a letter to the Department of Justice alleging previous Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan "willfully" gave false statements to the committee last year.  Waters said the matter involves "a potential violation of a criminal statue" and urged the Justice Department to review Sloan's testimony "and take such action as the DOJ deems appropriate."  Both the Justice Department and Wells Fargo declined comment to NPR regarding the letter.  As NPR has reported, Sloan, Scharf's predecessor, resigned in March 2019, weeks after he appeared before the committee. John Stumpf, the previous CEO, stepped down in October 2016 in the fallout over the accounts scandal. Waters pressed Scharf about whether customers who were harmed by Wells Fargo would be identified to receive payment and have their credit reporting fixed within 30 days.  Scharf said the company is in the process of trying to "remediate everything we possibly can" without giving a specific timeline. But he later added, "As of now, our plans take us into 2021 to ensure that all the payments are made appropriately."  The hearing also took place as the Trump administration is attempting to sway lawmakers in favor of a plan to stabilize the economy amid fears of a widening coronavirus outbreak.  
                Rep. Emanuel Cleaver bumped elbows — the new alternative handshake — with Scharf before he testified during a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee on Capitol Hill.

 Rep. Emanuel Cleaver bumped elbows — the new alternative handshake — with Scharf before he testified during a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee on Capitol Hill. Wells Fargo announced earlier this week that it would make $6.25 million in donations to support the domestic and global public health response to the coronavirus.  The bank's announcement did not specify whether it would provide relief for its customers if an outbreak should force workers to miss paychecks leading to late mortgage, credit card and other consumer debt payments.    "As we think about what we could be doing relative to late fees, missed payments and things like that, we want our customers to believe that we're a source of strength for them," Scharf told lawmakers.  Waters fired back, "I know that you understand we'll be looking for a lot more specificity than you have just described."  Other committee members, like Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the ranking member on the committee, lamented that lawmakers don't have the luxury to conduct "politically motivated ideological hearings on Wells Fargo right now." "There are serious things happening in the world while we're having this hearing," McHenry said, adding that investors fear the spread of coronavirus is impacting the financial services industry, the economy and the markets. "Our constituents have real concerns and they expect us to put aside politics and focus on the urgent matter at hand," McHenry said.

 President Trump, accompanied by Vice President Pence and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, met with GOP senators about the coronavirus on Tuesday. Updated at 7:44 p.m. ET One of the nation's leading infectious disease experts issued a stern warning on Tuesday: If you think you have escaped the spread of the coronavirus, do not become complacent.  "As a nation, we can't be doing the kinds of things we were doing a few months ago," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health. "It doesn't matter if you're in a state that has no cases or one case, you have to start taking seriously what you can do now." The briefing on Tuesday comes as the White House is beginning outreach to lawmakers about possible measures to protect workers and small businesses affected by the virus. While President Trump has promised action, officials have not yet announced any specific agreements. The U.S. has counted at least 712 cases and 27 deaths from the novel coronavirus so far. Fauci told reporters Tuesday that both the number of new cases and fatalities from the virus in the U.S. are expected to rise. Fauci said as the nation grapples with the spread of the respiratory disease, "everything is on the table for consideration," but he noted that the Trump administration is searching for the right balance between preventing future outbreaks while also not taking steps that are too extreme.  "For the country right now to say, 'We're going to close all the schools in the country,' I don't think would be appropriate," Fauci said, adding that the country should, however, "do real mitigation some time before you think you really need it."  Exactly what those measures might look like were not disclosed. Fauci said federal officials are working to get ahead of the virus as its spread continues, saying, "If and when the infections will come, sorry to say, sad to say, they will."  At the same Tuesday briefing, Vice President Pence said Trump had talked to Senate Republicans and asked for payroll tax relief and measures for hourly workers and small businesses who may not have sick leave plans.  The yet-to-be-unveiled fiscal stimulus package, including any kind of payroll tax cut, would need the support of House Democrats, who have their own proposals to combat economic problems caused by coronavirus.   Pence said White House officials would "fan out" and talk to lawmakers to move the economic relief package forward.  Other questions continue to swirl on Capitol Hill about how exactly the administration plans to pay for expensive measures like a suspension of payroll taxes.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working with Washington state, California, New York and Florida to develop community-specific recommendations to address the spread of coronavirus in those states and will publish recommendations in the next 24 hours, Pence said.  "The risk to the average American of contracting the coronavirus remains low," Pence said. "The risk to senior citizens with serious underlying chronic health conditions is very significant."  White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said it may be possible to work around Congress by using administrative authority to fund unpaid sick leave, but he declined to elaborate on any specifics, saying a deal is still being hammered out.  "We're checking with the leaders of both parties and both houses to see what is doable and where the tough nuts are going to be," Kudlow said. "In the near future we will outline a more detailed package for you."  Trump said earlier Tuesday his administration was working with the cruise and airline industries that have been battered by the coronavirus outbreak as he  traveled to Capitol Hill.  Trump did not announce any economic proposals after his meetings, but said "a lot of good things are going to happen." Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would represent the White House and Senate Republicans and handle negotiations over a final stimulus plan with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. "We're hoping that he [Mnuchin] and the speaker can pull this together so that we end up not playing partisan games at a time, which seems to me to cry out for bipartisan, bicameral agreement," McConnell said shortly after the meeting with Trump. Responding to a question about whether the president would be amenable to steps backed by Pelosi, including an extension of unemployment insurance, McConnell said: "I think the package needs to be negotiated. I think the speaker is obviously the most prominent Democrat here on Capitol Hill, and anything to get on the president's desk has to be agreed to between the administration and the speaker of the House."  Travel stocks have been hit hard by the uncertainty over the coronavirus, which has led conferences to be canceled, universities to close and travel to some nations restricted or barred. On Monday, the president said he'd unveil unspecified "dramatic" policies to counter the economic effects of the outbreak that has sent shivers through the global economy as entire national regions and nations have enforced lockdowns to stem the spread of the disease. "We are going to take care of and have been taking care of the American public and the American economy," Trump said Monday. The action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue comes a day after the stock market dropped precipitously. The S&P 500 was down nearly 8%. Markets bounced back somewhat on Tuesday as the prospect of a payroll tax cut rose.
Is The Economy Coming Down With Something?,https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/03/10/814023128/is-the-economy-coming-down-with-something,March 10, 2020, Editor's note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here.  It's been a crazy couple of days, and we showed up at the office Monday morning with as many questions as anyone. And we've been reading as fast as we can to try and figure out how to understand a spreading pandemic, a spiraling oil market, warnings of a coming recession, and the largest drop in the S&P 500 since the 2008 financial crisis. So here's a few of the best answers we found from around the econ universe.  What Does the Coronavirus Mean for the Global Economy? We've been talking a lot in the office about supply and demand shocks, which is econospeak for forces that knock economies off their trajectories. And we're starting to see them firsthand. A trendy noodle shop opened up across the street last summer. We haven't been able to get in because of the lines. On Friday, the city was pretty empty, and so was the noodle shop: That's a classic demand shock. We took advantage and got our noodles in five minutes. Monday we returned for more of the same. There weren't that many customers, but it took 30 minutes to get our noodles. Why? Half the kitchen staff stayed home. "People are paranoid," said the guy at the register. When an economy can't make goods because of a labor shortage, that's a supply shock. The noodle shop is getting shocked both ways, and so, maybe, is the economy.  The most authoritative discussion we found of this is a new piece from Gita Gopinath, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. She lists potential economic policies for governments to help deal with these shocks right now.   How Bad Is the Coronavirus?  One of the most helpful things that came across our feed recently is Justin Fox's piece for Bloomberg View, "How Bad is the Coronavirus? Let's Run the Numbers." As he puts it, "The coronavirus outbreak has been turning a lot of us into amateur epidemiologists." Though it's an opinion piece, it doesn't have a take. It just has numbers.  And as budding amateur epidemiologists ourselves, we read carefully about the medical term "R," which denotes the infection rate. Fox writes, "Could Covid-19 really spread as widely as the flu? If allowed to, sure. The standard metric for infectiousness is what's called the reproduction number, or R0. It is usually pronounced 'R naught,' and the zero after the R should be rendered in subscript, but it's a simple enough concept. An R0 of one means each person with the disease can be expected to infect one more person. If the number dips below one, the disease will peter out. If it gets much above one, the disease can spread rapidly." Right now, Fox says, the R0 of the COVID-19 coronavirus is 2.8, meaning it is on average spreading from one person to 2.8 people. But it is below one in communities like Wuhan, China, where it started. We think we're going to be hearing more about "R-naught," and we're hoping it goes below one.   How Should We Think About the Market? We don't do buys and sells and pops and drops and all that market-watching, but sometimes you can't look away. These last couple of days have been those kinds of days. Things got so disheveled today we actually turned on the television. But we learned more from the Wall Street Journal's Andy Kessler, who was an investor before he was a writer, and he does a nice job explaining how he (and the market) thinks about and prices risk. He argues that the risk is essentially a timeline projected into the future, and the pricing of the market reflects how long we think things are going to be uncertain. It's why as the COVID-19 coronavirus looks to be sticking around for longer, the markets are reacting more strongly.   Saudi Arabia Did What?  Oil prices plunged on Monday as Saudi Arabia declared it would increase production even though prices were falling. This basically never happens. Julian Lee, an oil strategist for Bloomberg First Word, looks at what the heck is going on with the oil market. Global oil prices are influenced by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and Saudi Arabia, an important member, appears to be mad at Russia, which is not in OPEC but is in a less tightly knit group known as "OPEC Plus." Lee says Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman aims to drive oil prices down "so far and so fast that Russia realizes it made a terrible mistake in refusing to agree to deepen output cuts at Friday's OPEC gathering."

Oil Shock,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/09/813831863/oil-shock,March 9, 2020, It was a hard start to the week for oil traders. And stock traders. In fact, pretty much everyone involved or associated with the markets. A spat between Russia and Saudi Arabia triggered a drop in oil prices of about 25%, which led to a fall in U.S. stock prices of about eight percent. The repercussions have rippled through markets all over the world. How did this happen? What part did coronavirus play? What does it mean for the global economy? So many questions!

Ethiopian Officials Say Faulty Boeing Software Played Role In Deadly 737 Max Crash,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/09/813740173/ethiopian-officials-say-faulty-boeing-software-played-role-in-deadly-737-max-cra,March 9, 2020,

 Rescuers work at the scene of the Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash south of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia last year. Ethiopian investigators said a flawed flight control system triggered by faulty sensor data, is at least partly to blame for last year's crash of a 737 Max airplane operated by Ethiopian Airlines. All 157 people on board were killed.  Authorities in Ethiopia also said training on the Max planes provided by Boeing "was found to be inadequate" adding that the flight control system, known as MCAS, was activated four times as pilots struggled mightily to regain control of the plane before the crash.  The findings of the interim report from Ethiopia's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau were released a day before the anniversary of the crash of Nairobi-bound Ethiopian Airlines flight 302.  A Boeing spokesperson said the company continues to extend "heartfelt sympathies" to the families of those killed in the Ethiopian Airlines crash. It also said it is awaiting formal recommendations from the final report.  "Boeing continues to provide technical assistance in support of the investigation, at the request of and under the direction of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the Accredited Representative for the United States.  We look forward to reviewing the full details and formal recommendations that will be included in the final report from the Ethiopian Accident Investigation Bureau," Boeing said in a statement.  That doomed flight, plus another one operated by Indonesia's Lion Air that crashed in the Java Sea and killed all 189 passengers and crew in 2018 led to a worldwide grounding of Boeing's 737 Max fleet. That global grounding has been in effect for roughly a year.  The crashes eventually led to Boeing halting production of the planes causing ripple effects through the aerospace giant's supply chain.  MCAS played a role in both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes. It is designed to lower the nose of the plane if sensors measure the AOA or "angle of attack" to be too high, which could cause it to stall.  But in both crashes, the information from the sensors was wrong.  In the Ethiopian Airlines flight, authorities found the plane's left and right AOA sensors differed by 59 degrees. The MCAS system took that erroneous information and activated – repeatedly pushing the plane's nose down during the six minutes it was in the air after takeoff.  The interim report found that at one point "the pitch angle dropped from 0.5 degrees nose up to -7.8 degrees nose down" and as a result the rate of decent increased from 100 feet per minute to more than 5,000 feet per minute.  The report adds that the pilots appeared to have recognized the problem and powered off the MCAS system. They then attempted to manually regain control and trim of the aircraft in order to bring the nose back up.  Eventually, the pilots turned the MCAS system back on, though the report does not explain why. That decision again forced the plane into a nose dive and the pilots were unable to recover.  The report indicates the plane was pointing down at a 40-degree angle and hurtling towards ground at a speed of more than 500 feet per second, when it crashed.  Ethiopian authorities don't cite pilot error as a cause of the crash, but do say the pilots should have received training in a cockpit simulator on what to do in a scenario when MCAS malfunctions.  For Boeing, returning the Max to service has been a top priority, though one that has not come easy. Boeing anticipated a swift return, only to see that goal  pushed back several times after regulators, particularly those in the U.S., pushed for more fixes.  This includes reports that federal regulators will issue an order to have some electrical wire bundles relocated on the Max planes because they are too close to one another and could catch fire. Since the grounding, Boeing discovered another potential hazard: tools and other debris such as rags and wrappers were left in fuel tanks during assembly of the planes.  Last month, Federal Aviation Administration officials said certain panels on the Max planes, including a metal layer that provides a shield for aircraft wiring, is prone to potential "electromagnetic effects of lightning strikes or high intensity radiated fields."  Boeing stopped production of the aircraft, which had been its bestselling plane, in December. Soon afterwards effects of the production slowdown began impacting businesses down the supply chain, including that of Spirit AeroSystems, which announced in January it was going to layoff nearly 3,000 employees.  Boeing said earlier this year the company estimates the FAA and other global regulators will move forward with "ungrounding" of the 737 Max by mid-2020.

 Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was halted briefly Monday morning when the S&P 500 index fell 7%, triggering automatic circuit breakers. Six minutes after trading began on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, it was suddenly halted. That's when the S&P 500 index had plummeted 7% and marketwide circuit breakers kicked in. Trading resumed about 15 minutes later. The marketwide halt was the first since the stock market crash of Oct. 27, 1997, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 554 points, or 7.2%. Under market rules, circuit breakers kick in at three thresholds: These automatic trading halts are aimed at preventing the market from entering a free fall, and Monday's halt did its job, with the major indexes coming off their lows once trading resumed. However, the indexes fell again later in the day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 2,000 points, or nearly 8%. The circuit breakers "are designed to slow trading down for a few minutes, to give investors the ability to understand what's happening in the market, consume the information and make decisions based on market conditions," New York Stock Exchange President Stacey Cunningham told CNBC. "It's really a precautionary measure that we put in place so that the market can slow down for a minute," she said. The circuit breakers were adopted in the wake of the Black Monday crash of Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow plunged 508 points, or 22%. "There was this idea that if you stopped trading and gave a pause, then people would calm down and it might stabilize the markets," said Mason Gerety, professor emeritus at Northern Arizona University and a former research economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission. His research in the early 1990s found a trade-off to the temporary halt. Traders might sell off more quickly if they anticipate a circuit breaker kicking in. "The fact that there's a circuit breaker might actually be more likely to get you to the circuit breaker. It's kind of almost like a gravitational pull," Gerety said. "People who do this for a living — I've never met one who felt like they needed to catch their breath," he said. "They have good lungs. They are used to stress."

 Remote work is not an option for home, health and nursing aides, who look after some of the most vulnerable, often themselves without health insurance and earning little. Shelly Hughes says three things are required to do her job: a strong back, a strong stomach and a big heart.  She's a certified nurse's aide at a nursing home in Washington state, which also means another requirement: To get her work done, she has to physically be there. "You're helping residents that may not be able to dress themselves, feed themselves, toilet themselves," Hughes says. "The great stuff is that you get to know wonderful people. I have so many grandmas and grandpas now, let me tell you." For many companies, the first call to slow the spread of the coronavirus is telling employees to hunker down and work remotely. But that's simply not an option for workers like Hughes — home or health aides, who look after some of the most vulnerable, sometimes themselves without health insurance and earning very little.  "We don't have the luxury of telecommuting," says Vanessa Jackson from Washington, D.C. She's a direct support professional who helps people with disabilities navigate everyday life, like paying bills, doing laundry and going to doctor's appointments.  The region has a severe shortage of workers like Jackson, says Danielle Darby, chief operating officer at Jackson's company, RCM of Washington. If many start to quarantine at home, "this could potentially be catastrophic," Darby says.  Shortages of professional caregivers are common across the country. Jobs for home, hospice and nurse's aides are growing fast and employ millions, but often pay minimum wage or just above. "I'm lucky because I actually have health insurance," Hughes says. "Most of the other nurse's aides in my facility — they don't have health insurance." She says her company offers a high-deductible plan, but many can't afford it. And she says her state has a shortage of certified nurse's aides — managers at her facility have been stepping in to fill the holes in the schedule. Hughes works the night shift alongside a nurse and a second aide.  "If one of us has a fever and is sent home," she says, "it's gonna be pretty hard to find somebody to come and work an eight-hour shift in the middle of the night." All caregivers who spoke with NPR walk a narrow line: They assure it's not  time to panic and know they're trained for flu and other epidemics. But they're also preparing for a potential all-hands-on-deck situation. Hughes works in Washington state, less than 100 miles from the nursing home — not too different from hers — that's an epicenter of a coronavirus outbreak. The illness is considered more dangerous to the elderly and has killed several residents. One of Hughes' best friends actually works there. Hughes has already used up her sick leave on a recent bout of flu. She has some personal time off and vacation time, she says, "but it's not a lot." Caregivers' access to sick time varies. Some states mandate that companies must pay their workers for time off, but most don't. Some agencies are flexible with paying for days off, others less so. Either way, missing a lot of work could spell trouble for workers. "It's pretty expensive to live in the Bay Area — and it would be a huge blow to my income," says California caregiver Sandra Mercado.  She says she gets a few sick days, but wonders if they would be enough. Her local agency Home Helpers has sent her lots of information about the coronavirus and has reassured her of a contingency plan.  "We're being much more vigilant, I think, about telling employees, 'Don't work if you're sick or you think you're sick," says Home Helpers Home Care CEO  Emma Dickison, who's also board president at the Home Care Association of America. Mercado knows it's the necessary call, but still worries about her clients that require help walking or even getting out of bed, who don't have family nearby — or at all. "If there's a quarantine, how do they survive?" Mercado says. "If we have to stay indoors for 14 days, who's going to help them?" Izella Hayes, a nursing assistant at a nursing home in a suburb of Detroit, points out other, less tangible ways the caregivers look after their clients and patients.  "When they come in here they see our face, we become their family. And sometimes when they take their last breath, they see our face again," she says. "I've been here 25 years, it sure ain't for the money. I like to make people feel good. I sing to them. ...  I just enjoy making people happy." And that's another thing you can't really do remotely.

 Wells Fargo, which has endured a cascade of scandals in recent years, announced Monday that two board members have resigned. Two Wells Fargo board members have resigned, including chairwoman Elizabeth Duke, the bank announced Monday. The departures come days after a House committee report found the bank has been too slow to reform itself in the wake of a series of scandals — including widespread fraud in the consumer banking business tied to overly aggressive sales goals.  Duke, who is known to many as Betsy, was elected chair of the bank's board effective January 2018. She had previously served as vice chair between October 2016 and December 2017. Wells Fargo said her resignation and that of another board member, James Quigley, were effective Sunday.   Wells Fargo has endured a cascade of scandals in recent years. The bank last month agreed to pay $3 billion to settle charges of collection fees for bank accounts, credit cards and other products worth millions from customers who didn't need or request the services.  In 2016, the bank was order to pay $185 million in fines and penalties after investigators found Wells Fargo employees opened as many as 2 million unauthorized accounts without customer authorization. The following year Wells Fargo announced that an outside review uncovered an additional 1.4 million potentially bogus accounts, bringing the total to 3.5 million.   Both Quigley and Duke were scheduled to appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. It wasn't immediately clear if they are still expected to testify. Last week, Democrats on that committee released an investigative report called "The Real Wells Fargo: Board & Management Failures, Consumer Abuses and Ineffective Regulatory Oversight." According to the report's executive summary, Wells Fargo was slow to "correct serious deficiencies in its infrastructure for managing risks to consumers."   It continues: "As a result, Wells Fargo's customers have been exposed to countless abuses, including racial discrimination, wrongful foreclosure, illegal vehicle repossession, and fraudulently opened accounts." The report also highlighted a 2017 remark from Duke in which she appeared to raise questions about why she was being included on messages from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau requesting that Wells Fargo take  certain actions to improve bank operations.  "Why are you sending it to me, the board, rather than the department manager?" asked Duke, who was then vice chair of the bank's board, according to the House report.  In a joint statement, Duke and Quigley said they were stepping down from their posts to "avoid distraction" and allow Charles Scharf, who was named CEO and president of Wells Fargo in September, the "ability to turn the page." "Out of continued loyalty to Wells Fargo and ongoing commitment to serve our customers and employees, we recommended to our colleagues on the Board that we step down from our leadership roles and they have accepted our resignation from the Board. We believe that our decision will facilitate the bank's and the new CEO's ability to turn the page and avoid distraction that could impede the bank's future progress," Duke and Quigley said in the statement.  Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee issued their own report on Wells Fargo last week. While the committee's minority found the bank failed to "implement an enterprise-wide risk management framework," it also placed some blame on federal regulators, who it says were "slow to take action that could have prevented further consumer abuses by Wells Fargo." The report added that Scharf's stated emphasis on complying with regulators "above all else gives the bank its best chance to move beyond the sales practices scandal and other consumer abuses that have plagued the bank for nearly 20 years." House Financial Services Chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., had previously called for both Quigley and Duke to resign, adding they had "failed in their responsibilities," The Hill reported last week.  It's unclear if the Wednesday hearing, titled "Holding Wells Fargo Accountable," will continue as previously planned now that both Duke and Quigley no longer hold their positions.

 A trader reacts on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. The U.S. stock market had its worst day since 2008. Updated at 4:39 p.m. ET Stock indexes tumbled so fast Monday that trading on the New York Stock Exchange was halted temporarily for the first time since October 1997. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2,013 points as fears grew over the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic. The blue chip index fell nearly 7.8%, and the S&P 500 dropped 7.6%.  It was the worst day for the market since 2008, during the financial crisis. The 15-minute trading halt — triggered automatically by a 7% drop in the S&P 500 — came shortly after the opening bell, when stocks tumbled in reaction to Saudi Arabia's shocking oil price cut.   It was the first marketwide trading halt since the crash of Oct. 27, 1997, when the Dow fell 554 points, or 7.2%.  With Monday's dive, the Dow and the S&P 500 are now down about 19% from their peaks in February. If the S&P 500 drops 20% from the recent peak, the stock market will be considered in bear market territory. The financial market chaos comes amid increasing worries that the coronavirus epidemic will plunge the global economy into recession. Stocks also fell sharply in Asia and Europe.  The price of oil also fell — down about 25% Monday following the unexpected Saudi move. As investors fled stocks and sought relative safety in government bonds, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 0.4% overnight before climbing above 0.5% during the day. Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia announced a stunning discount in oil prices — of $6 to $8 per barrel — and a boost in production. The move was a dramatic reversal from a few days earlier. Late last week, talks between OPEC and Russia collapsed after weeks of negotiations. The kingdom had tried but failed to get Russia to agree with OPEC to cut production to keep prices from falling in reaction to economic worries about the coronavirus.  The oil price war comes amid increasing fears that the coronavirus will hit the global economy hard as factories shut down, travel plans are canceled and spending grinds to a halt. In Italy's industrial region, 16 million people are under quarantine as the country fights to control the coronavirus outbreak there.  Worldwide, there are more than 110,000 COVID-19 cases, including more than 7,000 each in South Korea, Italy and Iran, according to a dashboard created by Johns Hopkins University's Whiting School of Engineering.  
Laundry Between Emails: Working From Home Goes Viral In The Time Of Coronavirus,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/09/812898220/laundry-between-emails-working-from-home-goes-viral-in-the-time-of-coronavirus,March 9, 2020, Early one morning last week, Cindy Ruiz joined the ranks of newly remote workers, now millions strong. The financial data firm where Ruiz works in sales closed its office after reports of coronavirus cases near San Mateo, Calif. For many, the widespread embrace of remote work is a welcome change they've always wanted. They're reacting on social media the way kids celebrate snow days: No commutes! Flexible schedule! Home-cooked lunch! Ruiz, however, is not in that camp. Sure, she says, there are some perks, if you could call it that: "I did do laundry." Mostly, she says she misses things at the office — her special headset, big-screen computer, and most of all, her colleagues.  Also, working from home is a pain. Her Wi-Fi is neither fast nor secure enough to access some critical websites — all of which reminds her why she left her last job, where she worked remotely every day. "You know, I am a person that needs to be in the office," Ruiz says. The coronavirus is putting remote work to a gigantic test, and at a totally unprecedented scale. Throughout China, Italy, Japan and South Korea, workers have been on lockdown. Last week, the same happened in Seattle. Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Google all told employees there to remain home. Twitter and payment company Square are also working remotely. And human resource departments everywhere are making contingency plans that include keeping workers home. It's an experiment that's also teaching companies a lot about how well they function when they're not all together. About a week ago, SquareFoot, a New York commercial real estate company, told its workers to work from home. The last time that happened was a year ago, when the office Internet went down. "Two-thirds of employees were like, 'Oh, but my laptop's at work,' " says Jonathan Wasserstrum, CEO of SquareFoot. This time, he wants to be prepared. But personally, Wasserstrum is no fan of remote work. He says it's impossible to read a room over a conference line. Plus, about a third of SquareFoot's staff are brokers — they tour buildings with clients. "If all of a sudden they said you can't have face-to-face meetings with people, it'd be harder for us to do a bunch of those transactions," Wasserstrum says. In fact, remote work isn't always possible. Fewer than half could do so at least some of the time, according to one Gallup survey. Hourly workers don't get paid if they don't work, and those in retail, manufacturing, or health care usually must be physically present to work. But it's a huge recruitment tool, and a big perk for people like Tristan Guyette, a field manager for a nonprofit who loves working from home in Toledo, Ohio. "For me, it's a lot easier to work in silence," Guyette says. "I also appreciate the fact that I can migrate from room to room, if I'm not feeling super productive." Guyette has a weak immune system and can relate to the many remote workers around the world staying home for health reasons.  Webcams are good stand-ins for in-person meetings, Guyette says. "I also realize not everybody is built for this. If you're very  extroverted — which is not me — you probably would not enjoy this as much as I do." Guyette hopes the coronavirus will help promote remote work. "If employees don't have to come in, they're not paying to commute, they're not adding to the carbon footprint, [and] they don't have to buy or bring a lunch." It's not clear whether the coronavirus will change Wasserstrum's mind about remote work. His company ordered loads of hand sanitizer and told employees to come back to the office. "I don't believe people are as productive at home," he says. But he may rethink that. He's worried about his wife, who is seven months pregnant and still commuting to her job on the subway. "We'll see how much longer we keep sending her to do that," he says.

 Oil prices dropped 30% Sunday after Saudi Arabia announced it would boost production and cut prices. Updated at 10:52 p.m. ET Oil prices and stock indexes were in freefall Sunday after Saudi Arabia announced a stunning discount in oil prices — of $6 to $8 per barrel — to its customers in Asia, the United States and Europe.  Benchmark Brent crude oil futures dove 30% — the steepest drop since the Gulf War in 1991 — in early trading Sunday night before recovering slightly to a drop of 24%. The benchmark Brent crude oil price fell below $34 per barrel. The oil price shocks reverberated throughout financial markets. Dow futures dropped more than 1,000 points, S&P 500 futures hit their limits after tumbling 5%, and the key 10-year Treasury note yield fell below 0.5%, a record low. Saudi Arabia, the world's second-largest producer, this weekend said it will actually boost oil production instead of cutting it to stem falling prices, in a dramatic reversal in policy.  Late last week, Saudi Arabia, the rest of OPEC and Russia failed to agree on production cuts to combat falling prices because of fears that the coronavirus epidemic will halt world economic growth. Oil prices were down more than 30% this year before Sunday's collapse. U.S. consumers are likely to see lower prices at the gas pump, but American oil producers — who lead the world in output — could be hurt by the oil price slide. Economies from China to Italy have ground to a halt as quarantines shut down factories and demand for products and services craters. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members sought to cut production to shore up oil prices. But the once-powerful cartel can no longer move markets alone. It needs the support of Russia, which is not an OPEC member but has recently been coordinating with the organization. Yet Russia has resisted calls for production cuts. On Friday, the talks ended in failure. OPEC and its allies announced no new reductions and didn't even commit to extending current cuts. So, Saudi Arabia is doing an about-face. If it can't get the price back up, it's going to drive the price way down. It's offering to cut the oil price for the U.S. market by $7 per barrel, to Europe by $8 and Asia by $6. Paired with Saudi Arabia's ability to rapidly increase production — flooding the market with cheap crude — those unilateral price cuts will push the price of oil down for everyone. Low oil prices are bad for Saudi Arabia's budget, and the price of the Saudi oil company Aramco's stock tumbled below its initial public offering price on Sunday. But, because Saudi Arabia's production costs are the lowest in the world, lower prices can hit other producers harder. Russia seems to be the target of this price war. But as Saudi Arabia tries to grab market share with bargain-basement prices, American oil and gas producers, including the fracking industry, will also feel pain. And even with ample supply and low production costs, Saudi Arabia is not guaranteed to come out on top in a prolonged face-off with Russia — especially if fears of a pandemic keep planes grounded and cars in driveways no matter how cheap crude oil gets.   "They're cutting prices, they're going to increase production. But it's not clear they're going to have buyers for that oil," says Ellen Wald, an energy markets analyst and the author of Saudi, Inc. "It's entirely possible that they may not have the wherewithal and the will and the toughness to withstand a price war and a production war with Russia." Still, lower fuel prices will offer some relief to the airline industry, which is feeling the strains of the coronavirus crisis, with travel cancellations leading to flight cuts.
Coronavirus And The Labor Market,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/06/813037776/coronavirus-and-the-labor-market,March 6, 2020, The U.S. economy added 273,000 jobs last month, and the unemployment rate fell to a very low 3.5 percent. However, because unemployment data is collected in the first half of the month, it means those healthy figures do not reflect the effects that coronavirus might be having on the labor market. Today we talk with Martha Gimbel of Schmidt Futures about how the way the U.S. labor market is structured and has developed could make it vulnerable to a widespread coronavirus outbreak.

 Employers continued to add jobs in February, and the unemployment rate remained near historic lows. Updated at 10:31 a.m. ET Fear of the coronavirus doesn't appear to have infected the U.S. job market yet, despite sending shivers through Wall Street. A new report from the Labor Department says employers added 273,000 jobs in February — the same as in January. The February increase was about 100,000 more than private analysts had forecast. The unemployment rate dipped to 3.5%, matching a 50-year low. Job gains for December and January were revised up by a total of 85,000. The evident resilience in the jobs report may be an artifact of timing. The report is based on surveys conducted three weeks ago, before the sharp jump in reports of coronavirus cases outside of China, where the outbreak began. "The February jobs report showed remarkably healthy labor market fundamentals prior to the coronavirus outbreak," said Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics. "But while strong employment and steady wage gains have boosted consumers' immune system, the virus is all but certain to infect their willingness to spend." He warned that business and consumer caution about the virus is likely to weigh on job growth in the months to come. The pace of hiring in February was higher than the previous three months, in which employers added an average of 239,000 jobs. But there was little sign of the coronavirus contagion that's triggered a widespread selloff in the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 970 points on Thursday and was down about 500 points Friday morning. The blue chip index has fallen about 13% from its peak in early February. The S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq have each tumbled more than 10% from their recent highs. Futures markets point to further declines on Friday.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. U.S. construction companies continued to expand in February, adding 42,000 workers. Construction has gotten a boost in recent months from higher-than-usual temperatures and lower-than-usual interest rates. The rate on an average, 30-year mortgage fell to an all-time low this week: 3.29%. The hospitality business has been growing rapidly, adding tens of thousands of jobs in recent months, and that trend continued in February with 51,000 new jobs. That growth could slow, however, as fear about the spreading coronavirus discourages travel and tourism. The retail, transportation and warehouse industries showed modest job declines in February. Manufacturers, who are especially sensitive to global shocks like coronavirus, added 15,000 jobs in February after cutting a revised 20,000 jobs the month before. A survey of manufacturers released earlier this week showed factory activity expanded in February, albeit slowly. Many of the survey respondents said the coronavirus outbreak is playing havoc with their suppliers in China. Analysts warn that a shortage of parts from that country is likely to get worse before it gets better. While Chinese factories that were shuttered by the outbreak have begun to reopen, most are not operating anywhere close to capacity. "Some of the delays caused by this [will] only materialize as that works its way through the supply chain," said Shawn DuBravac, chief economist for IPC, an association of electronics manufacturers. "It could be April and May when we actually see some of that delay materialize." Governments added 45,000 workers in February. About 7,000 of those were temporary census employees, but the largest share were state educators. The share of American adults who are working or looking for work was unchanged last month. Average wages have increased 3% over the past year, a slight deceleration from the previous month.
Paid Family Leave Bill Faces An Uphill Fight In Colorado,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/06/810139462/paid-family-leave-bill-faces-an-uphill-fight-in-colorado,March 6, 2020,

 Colorado State Sen. Brittany Pettersen with her husband Ian Silverii and their dog Ollie, last August in their home in Colorado. Petterson, who gave birth to the couple's son this year, has lobbied hard to expand paid family and medical leave throughout the state. When Brittany Pettersen, a Colorado state senator, gave birth to a boy in January, she became only the second lawmaker in the state to have a baby during a legislative season. The first, Sen. Barbara Holme, delivered just two days before lawmakers adjourned nearly 40 years ago. But because she was part of a Democratic minority at the time, no one worried much about the votes Holme was missing, much less her need for paid maternity leave. "That was the year I was born," says Pettersen, also a Democrat. "Unfortunately, we haven't come very far from 1981." Despite the inroads women have made entering the workforce and politics, paid family and medical leave remains a heavy lift in Colorado and across much of the country. For each of the past six years, the Colorado legislature has considered bills to establish a statewide paid leave program, but none have passed. Yet this year, with a Democratic governor, Democratic control of both the state House and Senate, plus more female legislators than ever before, many thought it would be the best chance for a paid leave bill in the 30 years since Holme had her baby. Pettersen has become something of a poster child — perhaps, a poster mom — for this year's legislative push. While undoubtedly many male lawmakers have had children while serving, her fellow senators may find Pettersen's example hard to ignore if a paid leave bill comes to the floor. "This is our opportunity to help Coloradans. And we're going through it, even in our workplace," says Pettersen, who took one month of paid leave from her legislative work. (Colorado legislators are allowed to take up to 40 days of fully compensated leave, but their salary is reduced if they're out longer for anything other than a medical illness.) Still, even after a bipartisan task force came to broad consensus this year for a mandatory paid family leave benefit run by the state and funded through payroll taxes, Coloradans may have to settle for something far less ambitious if anything passes at all. The fight illustrates just how divisive paid family leave can be when determining how to pay for it. Legislative hurdles Under federal law, employers with 50 or more employees are required to grant workers time off to deal with family or medical issues, including the birth of a child or the care of an aging parent. But companies are not required to pay workers for that time off. Many of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have backed paid leave and President Donald Trump's budget envisioned a paid family leave program. Congress is now considering the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act that would provide workers up to 12 weeks of partial income for family leave regardless of the company's size, funded through a payroll tax of 2 cents per $10 in wages. Congress passed a bill last year that will grant 12 weeks of paid family leave to federal employees, beginning in October. Some states have sought to fill the gaps and, so far, eight states — California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington — along with the District of Columbia have established paid family leave programs, funded through payroll taxes. For a while, at least, Colorado looked poised to join them. Colorado Republicans have killed paid leave bills in years past. But last year, when Democrats took control, paid leave looked like a possibility. "That's also when all the details really started to matter," says Kathy White, deputy director of the Colorado Fiscal Institute, a nonprofit research and policy advocacy organization, which backed a paid leave benefit. As a result, the 2019 paid leave bill was the most lobbied legislation in Colorado that session, according to backers, with more than 200 lobbyists registered as working on it. But, ultimately, lawmakers were unable to come to an agreement and instead established a task force to study the issue. A broad consensus The 13-member bipartisan panel spent months poring through examples from other states and studies that looked at the costs and benefits of providing family and medical leave. They reviewed more than 1,000 public comments submitted in just 30 days. In January, the task force issued its final recommendations with broad consensus among its members. It backed what's called a state-run social insurance model to levy a small payroll tax to cover the paychecks of those taking paid leave. "This has become a really big issue because the research is becoming so clear," White says. "We can see the difference between those who have leave and those who don't have leave or have to take unpaid leave for caregiving needs." A state-commissioned review found strong evidence that paid leave decreased infant mortality by 10% to 13%, increased the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months, increased childhood immunization rates and improved maternal mental health. But the task force recommendations were met with objections from various lawmakers, as well as Gov. Jared Polis. He had asked the task force to consider paid leave models other than a state-run program. Some opposed the new payroll taxes, while others were concerned about the state's potential costs if payroll taxes don't collect enough. Critics have argued that paid leave mandates offer employers little flexibility to meet an employee's specific needs — and can create an economic burden for businesses. By February, the bill's sponsors had shifted to a compromise that would require companies to offer paid family and medical time off, but would leave it up to employers to determine how to provide that. It's not nearly the benefit that paid-leave advocates had hoped for. "I would have preferred a social insurance plan," says Democratic Sen. Faith Winter, the bill's lead sponsor. "Ultimately, you could have a perfect bill that doesn't pass, or you could have a good bill that passes." Waning support Now it's unclear whether the compromise bill has given up too much ground to pass. Already, two of Winter's Democratic co-sponsors have dropped their names from the revised bill, calling into question whether it will have enough votes. "It's a big program with lots of details, and it impacts every person in the state," Winter says. "When you start moving things that affect everyone and every business, that means everyone cares." The coalition of nonprofits and advocacy groups pushing for paid family and medical leave does have a backstop. Early this year, proponents registered two paid leave ballot measures for the November elections. "Colorado families overwhelmingly want and expect the legislature to move forward with a plan to provide family and medical leave this year," says Lynea Hansen, a spokesperson for Colorado Families First, a nonprofit that has been lobbying in favor of a paid leave bill. "If the legislature is unsuccessful at passing a comprehensive policy, we plan to take this initiative to the voters." It's unknown whether the backers of the ballot measure would continue to press the issue if the legislature passes the compromise bill instead of the full state-run benefit advocates sought. "What happens if the legislature does do something and it's still not good enough for the advocates?" asks Loren Furman, senior vice president of state and federal relations for the Colorado Chamber of Commerce, which has been supportive of a paid leave bill. "Are they then going to continue down the path of the ballot initiative?" If nothing else, the additional time it took to rework the bill has allowed Pettersen to be back from her one-month maternity leave in time for debate on the bill. The Democrats hold a slim 19-16 margin in the Senate and cannot count on a strict party-line vote, because some party members are wavering in their support for the new approach. Pettersen has pledged to bring her infant son, Davis, to the chamber floor for the crucial vote — a tangible display of what's at stake. "It's just another reminder," she says. "There are numerous moms that have been elected. But absolutely, having the experience of someone going through it right now is going to impact what we're talking about."

 Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, speaks at the Bloomberg Global Business Forum in September. Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase & Co., is "recovering well" from emergency heart surgery, the bank announced on Thursday. Dimon, 63, who is the longest-serving head of a major U.S. bank, experienced "an acute aortic dissection," and underwent surgery to repair it on Thursday morning, JPMorgan co-Presidents Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith said in a company memo. "The good news is that it was caught early and the surgery was successful," the memo said, adding that Dimon is "awake, alert and recovering well." Dimon was a key financial industry figure during the 2008 financial crisis in which numerous banks were bailed out by the government. JPMorgan accepted $25 billion under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and brokered a weekend deal to purchase the ailing Bear Stearns. In 2012, JPMorgan lost $5.8 billion after a London-based trader nicknamed the "London whale" took risky positions in credit derivatives. At the time, Dimon said "I should have caught it ... I didn't." "We made a stupid error," he said in a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. "We screwed up." In 2014, Dimon was diagnosed with throat cancer. He reduced travel and made fewer public appearances during treatment, but recovered.

 Due to coronavirus fears, violinist Renaud Capuçon and the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra play for an empty hall in Lausanne, Switzerland on March 4. (The concert was broadcast by Swiss public media.) On Wednesday night in Switzerland, the French violinist Renaud Capuçon and the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra played a full concert — to an empty hall. Their performance, which was canceled after the Swiss government prohibited all gatherings of 1000 or more people, was broadcast by Swiss public television and radio. It's just one of the ways that performers and organizations worldwide are grappling with the uncertainties of the coronavirus, and how to handle large gatherings of audiences in close quarters. The Western classical music industry is now heavily reliant upon East Asia, and specifically China, as crucial consumer markets. In recent weeks, the Boston Symphony Orchestra has cancelled a tour of Asia and Washington, D.C.'s National Symphony Orchestra has cancelled three concerts in China. New York's famed Juilliard School, which is scheduled to open a satellite conservatory in Tianjin, China this autumn, announced at the end of January that it has suspended all in-person auditions and other admissions-related activities in China and Asia indefinitely. The list of American musicians and institutions who have already canceled tours or postponed other activities due to coronavirus concerns covers a broad range, including Green Day and Khalid. Even more directly affected are Asian and European musicians who can't perform in their home markets, like the megastar K-pop band BTS — who have canceled April dates in their home city of Seoul. In Japan, prime minister Shinzo Abe made a request on Feb. 26 that all large cultural and sports events be postponed or canceled across the country; the wide-ranging Hong Kong Arts Festival, which was supposed to take place across February and March with performers from all over the world, was canceled entirely.  Similarly, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra canceled all of its performances for February and March due to the health crisis; its musicians have been posting concerts, master classes and audio programs online, in part to help locals beat the tedium of being quarantined. In Italy, Milan's famed La Scala opera house has canceled a range of upcoming performances, including one featuring conductor Zubin Mehta and the Richard Strauss opera Salome. The global reach and frenetic pace of contemporary artists' careers is having an effect as well. Earlier this week, New York's Metropolitan Opera requested that all visiting artists who are arriving from countries already deeply affected by the COVID-19 outbreak — including Italy, China and South Korea — to self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in New York before beginning rehearsals at the house.  One of the biggest annual K-pop events in the U.S., a concert sponsored by the Korea Times Media Group that was supposed to feature at least a dozen Korean music acts and which was scheduled to take place at the Hollywood Bowl on Apr. 25, has been postponed indefinitely. But cities that host large-scale music and entertainment gatherings are loathe to cancel events that can be big economic drivers — and event organizers and local government officials are grappling with those decisions very publicly. For example, on Tuesday afternoon, Miami mayor Carlos Giménez wrote on Twitter: "We're not canceling any major events in Miami-Dade County, such as Ultra, following the guidance from Florida's surgeon general on #coronavirus." He was referring to the popular, annual Ultra Music Festival, which is scheduled for March 20 to 22, and which last year drew about 170,000 EDM fans. By Wednesday, however, the organizers' thinking seemed to evolve, and Ultra is, according to the Miami Herald, on the brink of being canceled. (As of publishing time, Ultra had not made an official announcement.) Strikingly, a sister event in the United Arab Emirates — Ultra Abu Dhabi, which was scheduled to take place this Thursday and Friday — had already been canceled due to coronavirus concerns. The annual SXSW conference and festivals in Austin, Texas, encompasses technology,  music and film — and drew over 417,000 attendees in 2019, according to organizers' estimates. They say that this year's events, scheduled for March 13 to 22, are still on. (In past years, NPR Music has had a significant presence at SXSW, and as of publication, a range of NPR journalists and employees are scheduled to participate this year as well.) On Monday, the organizers put out a statement saying, "SXSW is working closely on a daily basis with local, state, and federal agencies to plan for a safe event. ... The health of the Austin community and those who visit our city is our highest priority." At a press conference on March 4, Austin Public Health's Dr. Mark Escott said, "There is no evidence that closing SXSW or other activities is going to make the community safer." Later in his comments, Escott said, "One of the concerns is if we shut down — or make the recommendation to shut down — SXSW, people will still continue to come here. They will travel, they will still do what they were going to do, but without that organizational structure that SXSW provides." Nevertheless, an online petition asking SXSW to cancel this year's event has, as of Thursday afternoon, attracted more than 50,000 signatures. And a number of prominent tech and media companies — including Facebook, Twitter, Intel, Vevo, Mashable, Amazon Studios, TikTok, Netflix and WarnerMedia (which owns CNN and HBO, among other properties) — have all decided to withdraw from SXSW this year, due to coronavirus fears. So have some notable individual speakers, including Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and best-selling author Tim Ferriss. On Twitter, Ferriss explained his decision: "I love SXSW, but I don't believe the novel coronavirus can be contained, and I view an int'l event of 100K+ people as a huge risk to attendees and the entire city, given limited ICU beds, etc. I implore [Austin mayor Steve] Adler and his team to carefully evaluate the downsides. SXSW brings huge economic benefit to Austin, but possibly making Austin a hotspot for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, and the emergency actions and funding that would require, could make a huge event seem shortsighted." SXSW is downplaying those absences, however — and in recent days, event organizers have announced a starry array of speakers added to its lineup, including Hillary Clinton, Rep. Adam Schiff, Katie Couric and RZA. On a "COVID-19 attendee information" page last updated on Monday, the organizers say: "At this time, there are a handful of cancellations from participants who were traveling from China and Japan and there have been a few corporate travel bans. Other than that, the cancellations are on par from past years." Undeniably, the event provides a massive economic boost to Austin each year — according to its own most recent analysis, SXSW was worth nearly $356 million to the city in 2019. Audience members who have already purchased SXSW passes but who are now uncertain that they want to attend — or who are being curtailed from traveling to the United States — seem to be out of luck. According to social media posts, individuals who have requested refunds or deferrals to the 2021 edition due to coronavirus issues are being told that their 2020 tickets are nonrefundable. NPR reached out repeatedly to SXSW for comment, but organizers did not respond.

 Amazon is among the companies telling workers in the Seattle area to stay home as the coronavirus outbreak spreads. Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are telling employees in the Seattle area to work from home as the business world tries to reduce risks from the spreading coronavirus outbreak. Facebook said a contractor in one of its Seattle offices had been diagnosed with the disease caused by the virus. The worker was last in the office on Feb. 21, and Facebook has closed the office until March 9. The company is encouraging all employees in Seattle to work from home through the end of the month. "We've notified our employees and are following the advice of public health officials to prioritize everyone's health and safety," a Facebook spokesperson said. An Amazon employee at the company's Seattle headquarters has also contracted the virus, the company said. "We are recommending that employees in Seattle/Bellevue who are able to work from home do so through the end of the month," an Amazon spokesperson said. Google and Microsoft are also recommending that employees in the Seattle area work from home if possible. American companies including IBM, JPMorgan Chase and Apple are restricting travel and canceling big events or turning them into virtual gatherings, as they try to limit their employees' potential exposure to the virus. The cancellations are a blow to local cities and vendors and threaten to squeeze the travel industry even more. Stocks of airlines, hotels and cruise lines have all fallen sharply in the past few weeks. Here are the latest business impacts: Adobe canceled its annual summit in Las Vegas, saying it would become an "online-only" experience. Amazon is restricting all nonessential employee travel, including within the U.S. Employees may work from home if they choose. It is encouraging Seattle employees to work from home. A worker at the company's Seattle headquarters and two employees in Milan have contracted the virus. Apple has restricted employee travel to China, Italy and South Korea, according to Bloomberg News. Facebook called off its biggest event of the year, its F8 developers conference set for May. It said it would instead offer "locally hosted events, videos and livestreamed content." It also canceled its Global Marketing Summit in San Francisco. It is recommending Seattle employees work from home after a contractor in a Seattle office was diagnosed with the virus. Google called off its flagship developers conference, I/O, which was scheduled for May. It also scrapped its Global News Initiative summit and said it would turn its Cloud Next conference into a digital event. It has halted all international travel. An employee in its Zurich office has tested positive for the virus. It is also encouraging workers in Washington state to work from home. IBM said its Think 2020 conference, scheduled for San Francisco in May, would be held as a "global, digital-first event." It suspended domestic travel for internal meetings and participation in events with more than 1,000 attendees. It is also restricting international travel to "business-critical situations when virtual methods are insufficient." The International Monetary Fund and World Bank said their spring meetings would be held virtually instead of in person in Washington. JPMorgan Chase has curbed nonessential employee travel, according to Bloomberg News. Microsoft canceled its MVP Summit in suburban Seattle and said it would turn the networking event into an online-only gathering. It is recommending that employees in Seattle work from home and advising all workers to avoid nonessential travel to regions affected by the virus. REI, the outdoor equipment retailers, closed three campuses in the Seattle area for cleaning after employees reported possible exposure to coronavirus, local media reported. Salesforce prohibited international travel and restricted "all but the most critical" domestic travel and is making customer events digital instead of in person. Shoptalk, a major retail conference, has been rescheduled to September in Las Vegas. The event, which draws thousands of attendees each year, had been set to kick off on March 22. Organizers said the change was due to corporate travel restrictions as well as public health advice. Square, the San Francisco-based payments company, is "strongly" encouraging employees to work from home. It also halted nonessential business travel in the U.S. and internationally, and it is "discouraging in-person attendance at internal and external conferences and business events," according to a spokesman. Twitter is encouraging all employees to work from home if they are able. Workers in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea are required to work from home. It also suspended "all non-critical business travel and events." The Washington Post canceled nonessential business travel through the end of March.
Coronavirus Spreads Recession Fears Around The World,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/05/812183483/coronavirus-spreads-recession-fears-around-the-world,March 5, 2020,

 A man wearing a protective face mask walks at a nearly empty shopping mall in Beijing on Feb. 27. Business activity in China has all but halted, with entire cities under quarantine and industries forced to lay off workers. Updated at 4:10 p.m. ET As odds of a global recession rise, governments and central banks around the world are racing to fend off the economic damage from the spread of the coronavirus. The toll has already landed hard on jittery financial markets. Stocks continued to sell off on Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 969 points, or about 3.6%, as investors fled stocks. Companies have shut factories, canceled conferences and drastically scaled back employee travel.  In countries where the virus is most lethal, such as China and northern Italy, business activity has all but ground to a halt, with entire cities under quarantine and whole industries forced to lay off workers. But in a global economy, even countries that have been relatively unscathed by the virus so far, such as the United States, face growing risks from the "still-evolving corrosive shock from the virus," says Bob Schwartz, senior economist at Oxford Economics. How well the U.S. economy holds up "remains to be seen," he adds. "The outcome will probably determine if the economy stays out of a recession this year." On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve unanimously agreed to an emergency interest rate cut of half a percentage point in an effort to keep the wobbly economy on track. Central banks in Japan and the United Kingdom are also signaling they're willing to cut rates. Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate on Thursday gave final passage to a roughly $8 billion spending package to provide medical supplies in hard-hit areas and pay for vaccine research. President Trump has said he will sign the bill. Despite such measures, many economists now say growth is likely to slow considerably this year — if not contract altogether. Goldman Sachs projected on Sunday that because of the coronavirus, the U.S. economy would grow by an anemic 0.9% during the first three months of 2020 and would flatline during the second quarter. The epidemic has already cut into growth this year and may slow the global economy even further, depending on how long it lasts, the International Monetary Fund said this week. The uncertain outlook has sent the stock market onto a tumultuous roller-coaster ride not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, with turbulent drops followed by wild swings upward. Even the Fed's interest rate cut has done little to ease the market's volatility. After Tuesday's 1,300-point drop in the Dow, stocks soared again Wednesday. But stock indexes were down sharply on Thursday. The tumult in the U.S. economy still pales in comparison to the damage being felt in other countries. In China, auto sales cratered 80% last month, while a plunge in tourism is expected to push Italy and perhaps France into a recession.   Still, the list of U.S. companies that say they're feeling the epidemic's impact grows longer every day. Procter & Gamble and Ralph Lauren are among numerous companies warning that the epidemic will hurt sales because shoppers are staying home, especially in the booming consumer market of China. Others, such as Medtronic, Microsoft and Best Buy, say the virus has disrupted their supply chains in Asia and forced them to shut down production, at least temporarily.  Even when factories are reopened, many companies in China report difficulty finding enough workers to staff them, according to a survey of manufacturers by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. Apple has warned that it won't meet its sales estimates for the current quarter, in part because its major suppliers, including Foxconn and Flex, remain understaffed. The industries hardest hit have been tourism and travel, with many airlines canceling flights and companies such as JPMorgan Chase banning all but essential employee travel. The U.S. Travel Association predicts that international travel to the United States will fall by 6% over the next three months. "There is a lot of uncertainty around coronavirus, and it is pretty clear that it is having an effect on travel demand — not just from China, and not just internationally, but for domestic business and leisure travel as well," the association's president, Roger Dow, said in a statement. As more and more companies feel the pain of the epidemic, the odds of a prolonged downturn grow. "It is not just spending on restaurants and travel that is suffering, but also investment by businesses while they wait for the uncertainty to be resolved," Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote in the New York Times this weekend. "This will have long-term effects on growth even if the outbreak proves short-lived." But epidemics like this one don't come along very often, and economists don't have any good models to figure out what might happen. For now, the picture remains murky, says Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. "No one can say with much confidence how much harm the virus will ultimately do to people or damage to the global economy," he says.

 Prestige Ameritech Executive Vice President Mike Bowen, pictured in 2009, says his company can't keep up with demand for face masks used by doctors and nurses amid the coronavirus outbreak. Mike Bowen's been a very busy man.  He's executive vice president of Texas-based Prestige Ameritech, one of the few manufacturers of respirators and surgical face masks still making them in the United States. "I've got requests for maybe a billion and a half masks, if you add it up," he says. That's right — 1.5 billion. Since the coronavirus started spreading in January, Bowen says he's gotten at least 100 calls and emails a day. "Normally, I don't get any," he says. Bowen is at the center of a major problem that the coronavirus has made crystal clear: There aren't enough domestic manufacturers for critical medical supplies such as face masks. And even if production ramps up, it's unlikely to be enough in the current outbreak. Usually, businesses want orders to spike — they hope customers line up for their products. But Bowen is not pleased. His company simply can't keep up with demand. 3M — one of the biggest mask makers — is in the same predicament. It says it's stepping up production at its factories around the world, but it can't fulfill all the new orders. The World Health Organization this week warned against hoarding and panic-buying of critical protective gear. "Without secure supply chains, the risk to health care workers around the world is real," WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. "Industry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding." Concern about shortages of face masks used by doctors and nurses is prompting hospitals around the world to clamor for medical supplies as the coronavirus continues its infectious spread. In response, the Trump administration is looking at ways to rapidly expand domestic production, but the economics of the face-mask business makes that difficult. This is a cycle familiar to Bowen. During what he calls "peacetime," when there are no outbreaks, there are few buyers of masks. During an epidemic, there's suddenly limitless demand. "Imagine if, all at once, millions of people wanted to skateboard," Bowen says. "The skateboarding industry is not set up for spikes like that, and neither is the mask-making industry." 
                A Prestige Ameritech employee inspects disposable surgical masks in 2009 at the company's Texas factory. The company is one of the last domestic manufacturers of medical face masks.

 A Prestige Ameritech employee inspects disposable surgical masks in 2009 at the company's Texas factory. The company is one of the last domestic manufacturers of medical face masks. Prestige Ameritech, for example, owns a limited number of machines that assemble, sew and shape the masks. A decade ago, it ramped up production in response to the swine flu outbreak by buying more machines and hiring 150 new workers. "We made a really big mistake," Bowen says of that decision. It took about four months to build the new machines, which are as long as a school bus and cost as much as $1 million. By the time they were ready, the swine flu crisis had ended, demand vaporized, and Prestige Ameritech almost went bankrupt. "One day — and it is literally almost like one day — it just quits. The demand is over, the phones stop ringing," Bowen says. To make matters worse, the hospitals and medical supply companies suddenly had a glut of masks; they stopped buying for months. That was a business headache. But the recent shortages also show how a lack of steady orders can create a sudden national security risk. The seeds of that problem, says Bowen, can be traced back 15 years. That's when many mask factories moved overseas, where masks could be made at a fraction of Bowen's costs. Most notably, he says, Kimberly-Clark, which used to be one of the industry leaders, moved its operations. "The surgical mask supply went from being 90% U.S.-made to being 95% foreign-made in literally one year," Bowen says. For years, Bowen tried to get the government to pay attention to this issue. He wrote letters to Presidents Obama and Trump, warning that an epidemic could prompt China to stop exporting its supply, leaving American health care in a bind. He wanted the U.S. government to mandate that hospitals buy more American-made products. "If every hospital would pay just a few cents more for a mask, there wouldn't be an issue here," he says. The coronavirus is proving Bowen right. Now, he has the administration's attention. Last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told the House Appropriations Committee that the country needs 25 times more masks than it currently has stockpiled. The Strategic National Stockpile is essentially the country's emergency medicine cabinet, with reserves of vaccines and medical supplies stowed in warehouses around the country. Steven Adams, the stockpile's acting director, says the government now realizes it needs more mask factories in the U.S. "Coronavirus has made the theoretical risks seem far more real, I think, to most of us," he says. The government is looking to buy half a billion domestically made medical masks — a purchase that will take months or years to receive, after this crisis passes. "Our hope is that this can be a step and start moving the balance back toward a greater percentage being produced in the U.S.," Adams says. And he hopes it will also better prepare the country for the next outbreak.
A Push To Get More Women On Corporate Boards Gains Momentum,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/05/811192459/a-push-to-get-more-women-on-corporate-boards-gains-momentum,March 5, 2020,

 Ellen Kullman is one of the four women on the Goldman Sachs board of directors. The former DuPont CEO says she has developed a network of female executives and is giving recommendations to companies looking for female board members. Updated at 12:55 p.m. ET When Silicon Valley-based Adesto Technologies invited Susan Uthayakumar to join its all-male board last year, she had no idea California had just passed a gender quota. She's the country president and CEO of Schneider Electric Canada, where she's spent the last several years working in IoT, or the Internet of things, which powers devices like smart speakers and Internet-connected doorbells. "The reason I was brought on board to the Adesto board is because I had the IoT experience. That background is there for me, so I'm actually being asked to give my voice quite a bit," Uthayakumar said. "The board is very welcoming." Lately, a lot of accomplished female executives have gotten similar calls to join boards of companies headquartered in California. Among the largest 3,000 largest U.S. publicly traded companies, only about one in five board members are women, according to Equilar, which tracks corporate governance data. And it says nearly one in 10 boards have no women. In 2018, California became the first state to mandate gender diversity in boardrooms with the passage of a bill called SB 826. The measure, requires publicly traded companies based there to have at least one female board director — or face a $100,000 fine. At the time, the bill's sponsor, State Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson, called it a "giant step forward for women." Multiple studies show that corporations with female directors are more profitable, Jackson noted. If supercharging the push toward gender parity on boards was the goal, it appears to be working. The nonprofit advocacy group 2020 Women on Boards has been tracking changes at more than 400 major California companies. Before the law, 75 firms lacked a female board member, the group found. By the middle of 2019, two-thirds of those companies had added at least one woman to their boards. The law gave companies until Dec. 31, 2019, to comply. A report this month by the California secretary of state found that 282 publicly held corporations in the state reported compliance with the law, up from 173 in July 2019.  The idea is gaining traction elsewhere, where similar legislation being introduced in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Washington. And companies outside of California are also moving to add more female representation in the boardroom. TheBoardlist, a database that companies can search to find female directors, has experienced a 20% increase in inquiries — and not just in California. "I think there was this halo effect simply because the topic has been discussed so much more in the last year or two," said Shannon Gordon, CEO of theBoardlist. "Companies are kind of coming around to the value of diversity on boards." In January, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon turned heads when he announced that this summer, the bank will stop taking companies public in the U.S. and Europe unless they have at least one diverse board member. "I look back at the IPOs [initial public offerings] over the last four years and the performance of IPOs where there's been a woman on the board in the U.S. is significantly better than the performance of IPOs where there hasn't been a woman on the board," Solomon told CNBC. In his announcement, he cited his experience with his own board at Goldman Sachs. "We have four women out of 11. We have a black lead director. I really value the diverse perspectives I'm getting which are helping me run the company," Solomon added. Former DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman, one of the four women on the Goldman Sachs board, said California's law forces companies that resist change to take action. Companies have long chosen board members based on their network of friends and acquaintances. "That's where I think the history has led to mostly male boards," Kullman said. "Because if it's word of mouth and you ask the men, historically, they have given a lot of names of other men. So now, we need to do the same." Kullman, who serves on a total of four corporate boards, says she has developed a network of female executives and is giving recommendations to companies looking for female board members. "I'm not taking on any more boards. I've got plenty. But if people come to me with opportunities, I want to be able to point to four, five, or six different women," Kullman said. But in the year since its passage, critics have lodged a handful of lawsuits challenging California's law on grounds that it's discriminatory. The Pacific Legal Foundation sued California in November on behalf of electronics manufacturer OSI Systems shareholder Creighton Meland, a retired corporate lawyer. The suit argues that California's gender mandate for boards is unconstitutional. "The law violates the 14th Amendment's promise of equal treatment before the law. And it actually forces people to make decisions on the basis of sex," said Anastasia Boden, a senior attorney at the Pacific Legal Foundation. Plus, Boden says, mandating gender diversity ultimately hurts women "by relegating them to quota hires and making them seem like space fillers." As the data trickles in on the first full year of California's law, companies are now looking ahead to complying with the second leg of the law. By the end of next year, it calls for California-based companies to have at least two female directors on five-member boards, and at least three female directors on boards with six or more members. The law cites studies showing that having a critical mass creates an environment where women are no longer viewed as outsiders. "There's a 30% rule. When you have a minimum of 30%, that's when you see a transformation of culture and a true transformation of how business operates," says Shelley Zalis, CEO of The Female Quotient, a company aimed at advancing gender equality. "But we have to start somewhere."

 Pam Frank, CEO of ChargEVC, drives a bright Orange Chevrolet Bolt because she wants others to notice its an electric car. As the federal government takes a back seat in promoting electric vehicles some states, such as New Jersey, are taking the wheel.  There are nearly 1.5 million electric vehicles on U.S. roads today, according to the Edison Electric Institute. EV boosters concerned about climate change want even more and they say governments should help speed the transition away from internal combustion cars.  New Jersey passed an ambitious law in January aimed at having 330,000 electric cars on state roads by the end of 2025. And by 2040 New Jersey wants 85% of cars sold in the state to be electric.  N.J. Gov. Phil Murphy says the law is part of his state's goal of reaching 100 percent clean energy by 2050.  The law  includes up to $300 million in rebates over 10 years to electric vehicle buyers.  "And it's not just any old rebate. It's 'cash on the hood' rebate. You walk into a dealer, there's a car that's $35,000, that car's $30,000 to you," says Pam Frank, CEO of the group ChargEVC, which includes utilities, car dealers and environmental groups.  Frank is not just an advocate for EVs, she's an evangelist. That's why she drives a bright Orange Chevrolet Bolt.  "I wanted people to notice I was driving this electric machine, which I'm very proud of," Frank says. And if anyone asks she'll tell them it's fun to drive, it's fast, it reduces her carbon foot print and it's quiet.  Frank's group pushed for the new law, which also calls for charging stations to be built around the state to overcome "range anxiety," or the fear a car's battery will run out with no place to charge.  The New Jersey law along with incentives in states such as California, Oregon and Maryland, all come at an important time for utilities. After decades of steadily increasing electricity consumption, U.S. demand has leveled off, thanks in part to more efficient appliances and lighting.  If more EVs are on the road that means utilities will sell more electricity.  "New Jersey is an exciting one because outside of California it's probably the biggest piece of legislation that we've seen that's supportive of clean transportation," says Chris Budzynski, director of utility policy at Exelon. And the law comes as a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 is starting to expire. The credits are available for only the first 200,000 cars a manufacturer sells. GM and Tesla already hit that ceiling.  The Trump administration helped block efforts to raise that limit last December. As a field, Democratic presidential candidates are much more supportive of EV subsidies. So if voters choose a new president next November more federal help may come. Until then Budzynski is pleased to see states taking action to speed the transition to electric cars.  "This does represent one of the most significant or more significant opportunities for us, probably, over the course of the last 100 years with the exception of the introduction of air conditioning," Budzynski says.  Not everyone is happy with this trend. Oil companies, especially those focused on refining, stand to lose gasoline sales if EVs take off.  They've opposed some state efforts, often echoing arguments from consumer advocates such as Stefanie Brand, director of the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel. Her job is to defend utility customers' interests.  "Most of those customers can't afford an electric vehicle because the cheapest electric vehicle at this point is about $30,000," Brand says.   Often these state programs allow utilities to collect ratepayer money to build things such as charging stations. Brand says that's not fair because poor ratepayers are subsidizing wealthier ones who can afford an EV.  Electric car advocates point out everyone benefits from cleaner air and efforts to address climate change. And there are studies, including one focused on California — the state with the most EVs — showing a lot more electric cars on the road could actually reduce rates. Brand says there's a catch though, "Until you reach a critical mass of electric vehicles, you're not going to see those effects." For New Jersey's EV law, Brand says her concerns for poorer ratepayers were addressed. Money from a fund already dedicated to public benefits will be used for the EV rebates.  Still debates like this will continue as more states seek to boost electric vehicles. In fact, Pam Frank plans to take her orange Bolt and her coalition to neighboring states in the Northeast very soon.

 Twitter says it's deploying new policies that the social network hopes keep pace with the state of influence operations and disinformation today. Twitter is deploying new features on Thursday that it says will keep pace with disinformation and influence operations targeting the 2020 election. A new policy on "synthetic and manipulated media," attempts to flag and provide greater context for content that the platform believes to have been "significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated." Starting Thursday, when users scroll through posts, they may begin seeing Twitter's new labeling system — a blue exclamation point and the words "manipulated media" underneath a video, photo or other media that the platform believes to have been tampered with or deceptively shared. This could include deepfakes — high tech videos that depict events that never happened — or "cheepfakes" made with low-tech editing, like speeding up a video or slowing it down. 
                Content moderators will use this criteria to determine whether Tweets and media should be labeled or removed.

 Twitter's head of site integrity, Yoel Roth, told NPR that moderators will be watching for two things: "We're looking for evidence that the video or image or audio have been significantly altered in a way that changes their meaning," Roth said. "In the event that we find evidence that the media was significantly modified, the next question we ask ourselves is, is it being shared on Twitter in a way that is deceptive or misleading?" If the media has been modified to the extent that it could "impact public safety or cause serious harm," then Twitter says it will remove the content entirely. Twitter says this could include threats to the physical safety of a person or a group or an individual's ability to express their human rights such as participating in elections. When users tap on newly labelled posts, they'll provide "expert context" explaining why the content isn't trustworthy. If someone tries to retweet or "like" the content, they'll receive a message asking if they really want to amplify an item that is likely to mislead others. Twitter says they may also reduce the visibility of the misleading content. We know that some Tweets include manipulated photos or videos that can cause people harm. Today we’re introducing a new rule and a label that will address this and give people more context around these Tweets pic.twitter.com/P1ThCsirZ4 Evolution of interference Twitter was caught "flat-footed" by the active measures that targeted the U.S. election in 2016, Roth said. During that year, influence specialists used fake accounts across social media to spread disinformation and amplify discord. That work never really stopped, national security officials have said, and officials warned ahead of Super Tuesday's primaries that it continues at a comparatively low but steady state. Roth told NPR that while Twitter has not traced specific tweets about the 2020 campaign back to Russia, it is trying to apply what it learned from the last presidential race, including about the use of fake personae. "These would be accounts that were pretending to be Americans to try and influence certain parts of the conversation," Roth said in an interview with NPR's Ari Shapiro. While this tactic has remained a part of Russia's toolkit, the playbook also has continued to expand. In 2018, Russia didn't just interfere in the election, influence-mongers tried to make it look like there was more interference than there actually was. "We saw activity that we believe to have been connected with the Russian Internet Research Agency that was specifically targeting journalists in an attempt to convince them that there had been large scale activity on the platform that didn't actually happen," Roth said. This time around, rather than create its own messaging, Russia and other foreign actors are amplifying the voices of real Americans, Roth said. By re-sharing extreme — albeit authentic content — they're able to manipulate the platform without introducing any additional misinformation. "I think in 2020, we're facing a particularly divisive political moment here in the United States and attempts to capitalize on those divisions among Americans seem to be where malicious actors are heading," Roth said. The social network has studied fake accounts and coordinated manipulation efforts and have put its new policies to the test during elections in the European Union and India. Roth says Twitter has also built a community of experts, including community moderators and partners in government and academia. Another priority is transparency. When the platform uncovers "state-backed information operations" it shares the information publicly. 
                Twitter feeds will start to look different as the social network begins flagging posts that it thinks are part of broad deception campaigns.

 Twitter feeds will start to look different as the social network begins flagging posts that it thinks are part of broad deception campaigns. Weaponizing deception Foreign actors aren't the only ones likely to be impacted by this new policy. Misinformation can also come from American political campaigns trying to use social media to their advantage. Roth says he's already seen American 2020 candidates employ questionable tactics to get voters' attention. "We've seen ... accounts that are pretending to be compromised. So they'll sort of pretend that they were hacked and then share content that they might otherwise not have," Roth said, along with "large scale attempts to mobilize volunteers to share content on the service." While neither of these actions necessarily violate Twitter's policies, there are moments where they can cross the line. For example, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign hired hundreds of temporary employees to post campaign messages on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Twitter decided to suspend dozens of these pro-Bloomberg accounts. Roth says their decision was not based on the fact that these individuals were being paid to post content. "Our focus whenever we're enforcing our policies is to look at the behavior that the accounts are engaged in, not who we think is behind them or what their motivations were, because in most instances we don't know," Roth said. Twitter determined that the suspended accounts were "engaged in spam." If a large number of people organically decide to post the same message or similar messages at the same time, that isn't likely to qualify as spam, Roth said. But if individual users create multiple accounts just for the purpose of tweeting a specific message, then it does. They're over amplifying their voice in a way that constitutes manipulation. According to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, 82 percent of Americans think they will read misleading information on social media this election. Three quarters said they don't trust tech companies to prevent their platforms from being misused for election interference. Roth said the investments Twitter has made since 2018 to protect the "integrity of the platform" and ensure the security of its users has been significant — but he called that a balancing act. This is why Twitter's new policy doesn't remove all manipulated content. To combat false information, Roth says Twitter is trying to highlight information from trustworthy sources. For example, while Twitter isn't removing all false information regarding the coronavirus, it's making sure that information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is displayed prominently. "I think a platform has a responsibility to create a space where credible voices can reach audiences that are interested in understanding what they have to say," Roth said.  "That doesn't mean that we don't allow discussion of these issues throughout the product, but we want to ensure that when you first come to Twitter at the information that you see in our product is going to come from authoritative sources."
Coronavirus Fears Lead To Canceled Flights And Concerns Within The Travel Industry,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/04/812026357/coronavirus-fears-lead-to-canceled-flights-and-concerns-within-the-travel-indust,March 4, 2020,

 A flight information board displays canceled incoming flights from Italy at Ben Gurion Airport, near Tel Aviv, Israel, last month. Airlines are slashing hundreds of flights amid fear of the spreading coronavirus. Across the country and around the world, flights are being canceled, trade shows are being called off and businesses are cutting back on employee travel — all because of fears related to the spread of the new coronavirus. The sudden and unforeseen slowdown could cost the travel industry billions of dollars. The Global Business Travel Association estimates that if coronavirus-related travel restrictions continue, whether the travel cutbacks are self-imposed or ordered by governments, spending on travel around the world could drop by more than 37%, costing the industry a whopping $46.6 billion a month and nearly $560 billion in a year. "The last time we saw anything like this was 9/11," says Scott Solombrino, the organization's executive director. "But that was a complete shutdown of travel. Thank God we're nowhere near that." Not yet, anyway. But if coronavirus fears continue to lead corporations to pull sales staff, consultants and other employees off the road and if leisure travelers cancel weekend getaways and destination vacations, the economic cost could be staggering. Airlines in particular are already feeling deep pain. Several airlines are revising their financial outlook for the year, and it now may be difficult to turn a profit. The New York Stock Exchange airline index plunged 30% last week, more than double the drop of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. "Right now, across the Pacific especially, it's a bit of a mess for airlines," says Joe Schwieterman, a transportation professor at DePaul University in Chicago, who notes that airlines with routes to Asia, and China in particular, are seeing business screech to a near halt. And travel to Europe, the Middle East and other global destinations is starting to slump too. "International travel and international bookings are dropping. Some companies have just banned international travel altogether," Schwieterman says. And while there haven't been layoffs yet, pilots, flight attendants and other airline workers could lose pay as flight schedules are pared back and planes sit on the ground, as even domestic travel is slowing significantly. "We're seeing buyer apprehension," Schwieterman says, as the uncertainty of where the coronavirus may spread is leading travelers to hold off on booking "even cruises, summer trips. People are hedging their bets." The travel industry is being hurt further by the cancellation of big trade shows, conferences and conventions, including an energy summit in Houston that was expected to draw 4,000 people, a physics conference in Denver this week that expected to bring 10,000 people to that city, and the International Housewares Association's huge annual Inspired Home Show in Chicago, which was expected to bring in nearly 60,000 people March 14 to 17. The city's tourism agency, Choose Chicago, projected that the trade show would've been a $92 million boost to the local economy. "These big shows are lifebloods for the big cities," Schwieterman says, as the convention business often fills local hotels and restaurants. "You take that away, and there are a lot places that are financially on the edge right now and it's going to create some severe pain." But that pain, to some degree, is unwarranted, says Solombrino, of the Global Business Travel Association, noting that many people are abandoning travel plans unnecessarily. He says it's certainly appropriate to limit or halt travel to China, some other parts of Asia and a few other destinations around the world. "But in the United States, there are no travel restrictions that have been put in place on anybody by the federal government or a state government," he says, adding that there are also no restrictions on travel to Latin and South America, most of Europe and many other places. "So what we're trying to tell people and message people is that, 'Look, travel is still safe,' " Solombrino says. "Take the normal precautions you would take: Wash your hands, don't be coughing on people, you know, try to be diligent while you're traveling. But we don't see any reason why people wouldn't be traveling, certainly domestically." Nonetheless, the media coverage of the spreading coronavirus both in the U.S. and abroad has travelers worked up. "Everyone's freaking out, [saying] 'Oh my God, I gotta cancel my plans, my trip, my this, my that,' " says Tammy Levent, CEO of Elite Travel. Worried clients have her phone ringing off the hook and her email inbox overflowing. "Travel agents have to become psychiatrists, OK? We have to become therapists for all these people who call in." Levent says she and many of her fellow travel professionals spend a lot of time educating their clients about the coronavirus and the relatively small risk to most travelers. Levent has been able to talk most clients out of canceling their plans. "I've had one cancellation in all of our thousands of clients, which was to Japan." Many airlines are offering more flexible flight-change and cancellation policies, even waiving the often hefty fees for changing or canceling a flight booked to certain destinations that are considered at higher risk. United Airlines, for example, just announced that it is waiving change fees for any bookings — domestic and international — made between now and March 31, in an effort to spur travel or at least cut its losses. But Levent warns that those trying to cancel or change flights to destinations where there are no travel restrictions will likely have to pay the full penalty if they do cancel and that regular travel insurance may not help. Only "cancel for any reason" policies will allow you to get your money back. Still, many of those who are flying this week don't seem too worried. Arriving in Los Angeles from Cologne, Germany, Adrian Schmetz, 34, says he thinks the media is overhyping the coronavirus danger. "It's not as lethal as it's made to look like at the moment," Schmetz says. "It's not going to affect my choice of travel at all." But Los Angeles International Airport parking attendant Myla Maramba says business there is already slowing down, and she worries that a bigger travel slump could lead to a cut in hours or layoffs. "It's going to affect a lot of people's livelihoods," she says. And that's certainly true as the tentacles of the travel economy reach into the pockets of millions around the world.

 Vice President Mike Pence talks with airline CEOs about coronovirus as President Trump and White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx listen. Updated at 7 p.m. ET Vice President Mike Pence will travel to Olympia, Wash., on Thursday to meet with the governor and health officials and express support for the region that has been hit hardest by coronavirus. "By being there on the ground, I want to assure the people of Washington State, people of California, people that are in the communities that are being impacted by the virus, that we're with them," Pence told reporters, pledging federal resources to help. As of Wednesday, 10 people in Washington state have died after contracting the virus. The state now has 39 confirmed cases, many of which are linked to a long-term care facility northeast of Seattle. California has had one death and more than 50 positive cases, state health officials say, including 24 people who arrived in the U.S. on repatriation flights from outbreak locations in Asia. Pence held meetings with business leaders in sectors linked to the coronavirus response at the White House on Wednesday, including CEOs from nursing homes and commercial laboratory testing companies. President Trump joined a task force meeting with CEOs of major airlines to press for more cooperation with data that public health officials use to track down passengers when someone on a flight is later found to have coronavirus. "What we're asking for is additional pieces of information so that the CDC ... and others can track individuals as they come into the country and as they continue on to their final destination," acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told reporters. Asked whether the issue had been resolved, Wolf said: "I think we will continue to have conversations." The top lobbyist for the airline industry told the task force that airlines are working on a mobile app and website to collect information. "We think there are better ways to trace the passengers coming in," said Nicholas Calio, CEO of Airlines for America. The CDC is still working to trace people who shared a flight with a person from North Carolina who became sick with coronavirus after flying home from a visit to the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Wash., the long-term care facility that is considered to be the site of an outbreak. "We have the manifest. Now the trick is to go find them. That's why we're having this discussion," Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, told reporters. The airline CEOs told Trump and Pence they were taking extra steps to clean and disinfect aircraft. Oscar Munoz, CEO of United Airlines, said the issue was personal for him: He is a heart transplant survivor and has immune issues. He said his staff invented the "corona bump" – a greeting by elbow – which he called "a fun way of expressing what we all need to know." Trump has said his decision in late January to restrict air travel from China was a key factor in slowing the spread of the disease in the United States. His administration has added screening measures for travelers on flights from Italy and South Korea — two other hot spots for the virus — and he said on Tuesday he is considering further limits on incoming travelers for those two countries and Japan. Trump said the administration will continue to evaluate whether further restrictions are needed for international travelers entering the United States. "As certain areas get to be more of a problem, we may close them up, as we have done with numerous areas," Trump said. Pence met with Democratic and House lawmakers on Wednesday. Later, they approved a response package worth about $8 billion — far greater than the $2.5 billion that the Trump administration had requested. The Senate is expected to vote on the measure by the end of the week. Some of the money will be used to buy millions of face masks and other protective gear for health workers from 3M, Honeywell and other companies. Pence plans to visit a 3M plant in Minnesota on Thursday before going to Washington state.
Supreme Court Casts Doubt On Independence Of Consumer Protection Agency,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/03/811718978/supreme-court-casts-doubt-on-independence-of-consumer-protection-agency,March 3, 2020, If you have a mortgage or a loan or a credit card, you likely have more protection from deceptive practices in the financial services industry today than you did at the time of  the 2008 financial crash. But at the Supreme Court Tuesday, the court's conservative majority voiced skepticism about the independent agency Congress created to protect consumers from abuse in the financial services industry. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the CFPB enacted new rules to safeguard the mortgage market and protect consumers from abusive and misleading practices involving everything from credit cards to debt relief. The bureau is headed by a single director,  appointed by the president for a five-year term, and lodged in the Federal Reserve.  In order to ensure the director's independence, the law bars the president from firing him or her for any reason except malfeasance, inefficiency, or neglect of duty. It is that independence from presidential firing that is being challenged as unconstitutional by Seila Law — a law firm under CFPB investigation for misleading practices — and the Trump administration. Both the firm and the administration are asking the Supreme Court, if necessary, to strike down a long line of decisions going back almost a century, that uphold the structure of all independent regulatory agencies.  First up to the lectern Tuesday morning was Seila's lawyer Kannon Shanmugam. "Never before in American history has Congress given so much executive power to a single individual who does not answer to the President," he said.  Justice Sonia Sotomayor interjected: "You said that no other agency has this single director framework, but there are at least two, including the Social Security Administration ... which affects virtually every American."   Shanmugam replied that the Social Security Administration "poses no threat to individual liberty." "Whose liberty are we speaking of?" shot back Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   "What about consumers? ... Congress passed this law so that consumers would be better protected against financial fraud." Shanmugam pivoted, saying that "because of its desire to protect consumers" Congress had improperly created an agency "insulated from political control." Representing the Trump administration, Solicitor General Noel Francisco joined in the attack on the CFPB structure. He also got push-back from  Ginsburg who noted that it is unusual for an administration to refuse to defend an act of Congress.  Francisco replied that the "general rule is that ... we will defend acts of Congress ... but there is an exception" when a law infringes on the president's power. This law does that, he said, by not allowing the president to fire the director over policy differences. Other independent regulatory agencies, run by multi-member commissions are different, he argued, because they operate based on consensus.  The Supreme Court upheld the independence of those agencies in 1935, ruling unanimously that Congress limited the president's power to fire independent commissioners in order to protect those agencies' independence.  Ours "is a Constitution that does not say anything about removal" or "the structure ... of the government in general," noted Justice Elena Kagan. Given that, she asked "why not leave it to the political branches" to establish the terms for removal? The Constitution grants the president the power to execute the laws, countered Francisco. "The only way he can do that is if he's fully accountable," for his principle officers and they are accountable to him. But "removal is like a nuclear bomb," replied Kagan. There are many other ways a president can control officers — appointment, term limits — why this one? With the Trump administration joining the attack on the CFPB structure, the Supreme Court appointed former Solicitor General Paul Clement to defend the existing law.    "The issue in this case is like the thread on the sweater that if you start tugging on it, and you tug on it hard enough, potentially, the whole sweater comes undone," said Clement shortly after receiving the appointment. "The sweater here really is ... the entirety of the independent agencies ... the whole alphabet soup of agencies." During arguments Tuesday Clement took a beating from the court's conservatives. "What about the budgetary consequences?" asked Chief Justice John Roberts. Does that make the head of the CFPB "sort of ... the effective president over the significant swath of the economy ... they don't even have to go to Congress to get their money" because they get their budget directly from the Federal Reserve Board.  Kavanaugh jumped in, wanting to know what is "enough" for the president to fire the director of the bureau.   Sotomayor stepped in, asking Clement to address "head on" the "assumption that ... the president needs unfettered discretion to execute the laws."  Clement replied that it wasn't true for all presidential powers. For instance, when it comes to independent agencies like the Fed "we don't want the president to juice up interest rates right before a presidential election."  Similarly, he pointed to the current coronavirus situation, noting "people are trying to make a political football out of a pandemic ... Congress might decide that the head of the CDC (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) should be protected from removal," except for misconduct," because that'll make sure that people get good advice" not political advice.  Ultimately, he said, these decisions about whether and to what degree to insulate an agency from political control are Congress' call, and Congress has been making these calls for over 100 years.   Douglas Letter, counsel for the House of Representatives,  was last up to the lectern. Like Clement he faced incoming fire from the conservative part of the bench, especially from Kavanaugh, who as a lower court judge in a different case, made clear that he thought the structure of the CFPB is unconstitutional.  The next president, he suggested, may have to suffer the consequences of a CFPB director appointed by President Trump because the current director's term does not end until 2023. But that situation is not unprecedented. Letter pointed to the members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, who are appointed for 14-year terms, which means a one-term president is "very likely to have almost no influence over the Fed."  At the end of the day, there appeared to be five conservative justices unwilling to recognize that kind of independence for the CFPB, and four liberal justices with an opposite view.  A decision in the case is expected this summer.

 Travel restrictions, canceled events and work from home policies are becoming the new normal at companies as coronavirus fears mount. Updated at 11:57 a.m. ET Wednesday Google is the latest company to cancel a big event and curb employee travel as the global spread of the coronavirus outbreak has struck fear across the business world. The tech company called off its flagship developers conference, called I/O, which was scheduled for May in Mountain View, Calif. Last year, the three-day event drew 7,000 attendees. Google said the decision was "due to concerns around the coronavirus (COVID-19), and in accordance with health guidance from the CDC, WHO, and other health authorities." People who already bought tickets to I/O will get full refunds. The company said it would look for ways to "evolve" the event, raising the possibility of livestreamed or remote sessions. Several other companies and organizations, including the World Bank and the IMF, said they would replace in-person gatherings and meetings with virtual ones. The health and safety of our community is our top priority. After careful consideration, we’ve made the difficult but important decision to host this year’s #AdobeSummit and #MagentoImagine as online-only experiences. https://t.co/wQQVpAo0dy Google has also halted all international travel for employees after previously restricting travel to China, Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea. Last week, the company said an employee in its Zurich office had tested positive for the new coronavirus. An Amazon employee at the company's Seattle headquarters has tested positive for the virus. Amazon said it is "supporting the affected employee who is in quarantine." Two employees in Milan have also contracted the virus.  Companies across industries are clamping down on travel and avoiding events and conferences as fears over the spreading outbreak escalate. Some companies, such as Twitter, are urging or even requiring employees to work from home. Out of an abundance of caution and care, both @Twitter and @Square are taking significant measures to help lower the probability of spread of #coronavirus #covid19, including strongly encouraging all of our employees globally to work from home if able. More here: The restrictions are expected to affect the travel sector as well as the broader economy and cities and their vendors that rely on events to bring in revenue. Stocks of airlines, hotel groups and cruise lines have all taken a sharp hit in recent weeks. The U.S. Travel Association, an industry trade group, expects international travel into the U.S. to drop 6% over the next three months — the steepest fall since the 2008 financial crisis. "There is a lot of uncertainty around coronavirus," said Roger Dow, the association's president, in a statement. "It is pretty clear that it is having an effect on travel demand — not just from China, and not just internationally, but for domestic business and leisure travel as well." Several large industry events have been scrapped, including the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, after major companies said they would not attend. But some conference organizers are going ahead with their plans. Most notably, the South by Southwest music, film and tech festival is scheduled to kick off on March 13, despite calls to cancel. Facebook, Twitter, Intel and Vevo have all pulled out. A petition calling on organizers to cancel SXSW has gotten more than 36,000 signatures. The following companies are curtailing travel or events, or encouraging people to work from home: Adobe canceled its annual summit in Las Vegas, saying it would become an "online-only" experience. Amazon is restricting all nonessential employee travel, including within the U.S. Employees may work from home if they choose. Apple has restricted employee travel to China, Italy and South Korea, according to Bloomberg News. Facebook called off its biggest event of the year, its F8 developers conference set for May. It said it would instead offer "locally hosted events, videos and live streamed content." It also canceled its Global Marketing Summit in San Francisco. Google, in addition to canceling I/O, scrapped its Global News Initiative summit and said it would turn its Cloud Next conference into a digital event. Both events were slated to take place in the San Francisco Bay area in April.  JPMorgan has curbed nonessential employee travel, according to Bloomberg News.  Microsoft canceled its MVP Summit and said it would turn the networking event into an online-only gathering. Salesforce prohibited international travel and restricted "all but the most critical" domestic travel, and it is making customer events digital instead of in person. Square, the San Francisco-based payments company, is "strongly" encouraging employees to work from home. It also halted nonessential business travel in the U.S. and internationally, and it is "discouraging in-person attendance at internal and external conferences and business events," according to a spokesman. Twitter is encouraging all employees to work from home if they are able. Workers in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea are required to work from home.

Coronavirus: Update From Italy,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/03/811771769/coronavirus-update-from-italy,March 3, 2020, The coronavirus is showing no signs of slowing down this week, and its economic impact is continuing to grow as it spreads outside of China. When the American markets closed today, they were down almost 800 points. Japan, South Korea and Iran have all reported hundreds of cases.  The European epicenter of the virus is in northern Italy, the powerhouse of the country's economy. Italy is very integrated with manufacturing in China, and it is seeing the rippling effects of that economic relationship as the virus spreads.  Today on the show, economist Luigi Zingales talks to us about what the economic impacts of the virus may be in the coming months.

 The Trump campaign has filed a lawsuit against The Washington Post. President Trump's reelection campaign has sued The Washington Post claiming defamation in two opinion pieces published last June.  Both pieces raised concerns that Trump had invited Russia's help to boost his electoral fortunes. The lawsuit follows last week's defamation suit against The New York Times over an opinion piece written by the paper's former executive editor, Max Frankel, on the same subject.  The lawsuits dovetail with the president's ongoing political strategy of targeting major media outlets as foes. The president is once more represented by the lawyer Charles Harder, known for helping to run media and gossip blog Gawker out of business. Harder previously represented first lady Melania Trump in securing settlements after filing defamation complaints against the Daily Mail and a Maryland blogger. Harder has also threatened litigation against major news organizations, including NPR, for other clients who were subject to critical coverage.  The lawsuit against the Post, filed Tuesday in federal court in Washington, D.C., alleges Trump was defamed in columns by the liberal commentators Greg Sargent and Paul Waldman. Both referred to remarks Trump made to ABC's George Stephanopoulos in which he defended the idea of accepting damaging information about political opponents from foreign governments. In Sargent's case, he wrote that "Trump and/or his campaign....tried to conspire with" Russia's interference in the 2016 elections. Waldman's column asked: "Who knows what sort of aid Russia and North Korea will give to the Trump campaign now that he has invited them to offer their assistance?"  The president's lawsuit refers to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The suit maintains that the final report "concluded there was no conspiracy between the [2016] Campaign and the Russian government, and no United States person intentionally coordinated with Russia's efforts." The Mueller report did say it "did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in the election interference activities." But it also concluded that "the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts." First Amendment scholars tell NPR that prominent public officials must meet a tough legal standard to win defamation cases, especially those involving opinion pieces. That's even more true for the nation's chief executive, who is expected to be subject to widespread public criticism and scrutiny.  However, publications can be held liable for incorrect statements of fact made within opinion columns in which publishers are believed to have acted with "reckless disregard" or "actual malice" as defined under the law. The New York Times is still defending itself in a defamation suit by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who was incorrectly linked to the shooting of then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in a 2017 editorial. The newspaper later corrected the assertion and tweeted an apology from its opinion section account. Its lawyers have called it an honest mistake. The decision to have the Trump-Pence campaign sue on behalf of the president allows the president's costs to be borne by a special account funded by donors.

 U.S. stock indexes rose sharply on Monday in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut, but stocks fell again on Tuesday after the Fed acted. Updated at 4:22 p.m. ET An emergency interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve failed to mollify investors worried about the coronavirus epidemic, and stocks once again plummeted. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 786 points, a drop of 2.94%  after an especially volatile trading day.  All the major indexes have lost more than 10% of their value since their all-time highs, moving back into what the market calls a correction. The declines came despite a move by the Federal Reserve to cut a key interest rate by a half percentage point in an emergency attempt to shore up the economy at a time when the coronavirus threatens to slow growth. The cut was the largest by the central bank since the 2008 financial crisis and it came as the Fed faced growing pressure to address the impact of the spreading epidemic on the global economy. "The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity," the central bank said in a statement Tuesday morning. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. The Fed's move should lower the cost of borrowing, including for credit cards, auto loans and mortgages. The Fed cut its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 1% to 1.25%. But by cutting rates to such a low level, the Fed has left itself less room to move aggressively if the economic fallout from the virus should worsen.  "We do recognize that a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection," Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said. "It won't fix a broken supply chain. We get that. We don't think we have all the answers. But we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy." But some economists said the move would do little to address the real problem facing the economy right now: Fear of the virus is causing many people to stay home, shutting down factory production, hurting retail sales and reducing travel.  Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, compared the Fed's move to "putting a Band-Aid on an arm to cure a headache." "One is hard-pressed to see how precisely this easing in monetary policy will effectively counter fears of getting ill from this pathogen," he wrote. An extended outbreak will stifle demand throughout the economy as people avoid activities that could expose them to the virus, according to Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree.  "What's far less clear is whether a rate cut actually does anything to alleviate that demand shock," he said.  Powell acknowledged that a rate cut is only one part of the response required by the outbreak and that primary responsibility will rest with doctors, nurses and public health officials. Last week, stock prices had their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling by 12.5%, although it recouped part of its losses on Monday. The Fed left open the possibility of further rate cuts down the line, saying it was monitoring developments and would act as needed to shore up growth. Powell said that while fallout from the epidemic has yet to show up in most economic statistics, anecdotal reports hint at what's to come. The extent of the shock to the economy will depend on the duration of the virus and the extent to which businesses and consumers curtail spending in response to the outbreak.  Goldman Sachs is predicting the U.S. economy will barely skirt a recession, but it has lowered its growth forecast to 0.9% in the first quarter and zero in the second quarter.
Letters Urge Betsy DeVos To Erase Student Loans For Borrowers With Disabilities,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/03/811170628/letters-urge-betsy-devos-to-erase-student-loans-for-borrowers-with-disabilities,March 3, 2020,

 U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos testifies on Capitol Hill on Feb. 27. Updated at 9:44 a.m. EST.  The U.S. Department of Education must act to help thousands of student loan borrowers who have severe disabilities; that's the message of two letters sent Tuesday to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Because of their disabilities, these borrowers qualify to have their federal student loans erased. But one letter, signed by more than 30 advocacy groups, says the department has made the application process so burdensome that most borrowers never get the help they're entitled to. A second letter, signed by the student loan advocates of seven states and the District of Columbia, similarly urges the department to clear away unnecessary administrative hurdles and to automatically discharge the loans of all eligible borrowers with permanent disabilities. In a statement to NPR, Education Department Press Secretary Angela Morabito suggested the department is open to change:  "The Department's current implementing regulations require it to receive an application before completing a civilian [total and permanent disability] discharge, but we are interested in providing automatic discharge to these borrowers and believe the FUTURE Act makes this a possibility — but will require the department to undergo negotiated rulemaking."  The letters come after an NPR investigation revealed that only 28% of eligible borrowers with disabilities — identified by the Education Department between March 2016 and September 2019 — have either had their loans erased or are on track for that to happen. "That number is unacceptable. Twenty-eight percent is a shockingly low number," says Alex Elson, senior counsel at the National Student Legal Defense Network, one of the advocacy groups pushing DeVos to make improvements. For more than half a century, student loan borrowers with a significant, permanent disability have been protected by federal law: If they can no longer work enough to support themselves or repay their debts, they can have their federal student loans erased. The Education Department currently requires that eligible borrowers apply for help, but Tuesday's letters argue that the application process is unnecessary. In 2015, the U.S. government began comparing the Social Security Administration's records of Americans who have total, permanent disabilities to the Education Department's database of federal student borrowers. It then made a list of everyone whose name appeared in both. According to department data obtained by NPR, between March 2016 and September 2019, 555,000 borrowers with significant, permanent disabilities were identified as eligible for loan discharge. While the department attempted to notify many of them of their eligibility, ultimately, just 200,000 successfully applied to have their loans conditionally discharged and proceeded to the burdensome income-monitoring period. As of December 2019, only 156,000 borrowers have either had their loans erased or are still on track for that to happen. "The application process is standing in the way of critical relief for hundreds of thousands of eligible borrowers, thwarting the intent of Congress that their student loan debt be discharged," says the letter signed by advocacy groups including the American Federation of Teachers, the National Disability Rights Network and Easterseals. Both letters recommend the same fix: Automatically discharge the federal student loans of every eligible borrower who has met the federal government's disability standard for criteria known as Medical Improvement Not Expected. In short, they argue, don't make these vulnerable borrowers apply for a benefit that the federal government already knows they qualify for. "Getting to the post office can be cumbersome. Not everyone has a printer at home. These documents can be cumbersome," says New York state student advocate Winston Berkman-Breen, who cosigned one of the letters. "Putting in this application has a series of really difficult and high hurdles for someone who qualifies for the program. You know, it's sort of this perverse idea that the people who are intended to benefit from the program are the ones who are least able to access the program." In December, in response to NPR's findings, an Education Department official told NPR the department had made incremental improvements to the application process since 2016: "We continue to look for ways to make the process easier to navigate for disabled student loan borrowers, while maintaining the integrity of the taxpayer dollars associated with the discharges." Multiple legal and policy experts say if the department is genuinely interested in making these changes, it can.  "They have the authority to do this. The laws and programs already exist," says Washington state student loan advocate Stephanie Sampedro, who cosigned one of the letters. "[The Education Department] has already done it for some borrowers — for veterans who are disabled." In August 2019, President Trump and DeVos announced that eligible veterans with permanent disabilities would begin to have their loans discharged automatically. They would no longer need to respond to a letter or ask for help. In the presidential memorandum announcing the move, Trump offered a scathing critique of the discharge process, saying it is "overly complicated and difficult, and prevented too many of our veterans from receiving the relief for which they are eligible. This has inflicted significant hardship and serious harm on these veterans and has frustrated the intent of the Congress that their Federal student loan debt be discharged." The president's move was widely celebrated, but it has so far done nothing for the far larger group of civilians with permanent disabilities who are also legally entitled to the same loan discharge. "And now it's time for [the Department] to grant the same relief to civilians who, through no fault of their own, became totally and permanently disabled and are now struggling to repay their debts," Sampedro says. For the past two years, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers has similarly urged DeVos to automatically discharge the loans of all eligible borrowers with permanent disabilities.
Are High Mask Prices The Problem Or The Solution?,https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/03/03/811181309/are-high-mask-prices-the-problem-or-the-solution,March 3, 2020, Editor's note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here. Last month, Daniel Tamasi, an IT manager in St. Louis, Missouri, decided he wanted to take some extra precautions against coronavirus. He has a two-year old, and he and his wife are expecting, so he started searching online for masks to protect his family. "I thought it was going to be my usual two-to-three minute Amazon search and, you know, I'd be done with it," he says.   He quickly found out that Amazon didn't offer its standard, two-day shipping for Prime members like him. In fact, the earliest he could find a delivery was about a month out. "So I went to the online stores of basically every major pharmacy — CVS, Walgreens, Target, and those sort of places — and they were all out of stock." Next he tried brick-and-mortar retailers around St. Louis. Still no luck.   Finally, Tamasi turned to eBay. He searched for masks there, and they were crazy expensive. The cheapest masks he could find on eBay, he says, were about four times their typical sticker price.   Around the world, people like Tamasi are scrambling for masks, and prices are rising. According to online price tracker Keepa, a 30-pack of 3M's popular N95 mask was selling on Amazon for $199.95 last Tuesday. Normally, it's about 15 bucks. According to Nielsen, a retail tracker, sales of medical masks have seen a 319% surge in national sales over the last month compared to the same time last year. And manufacturers are struggling to supply the demand.   For economists like George Mason's Tyler Cowen, this is all the sign of a properly functioning market. Higher prices are the market's way of screaming: We need more masks!  "The normal economic view is that prices should be left free to make supply and demand equal," Cowen says.   Higher mask prices, he says, have at least two benefits. One is that people who need them the most are more likely to get them. At this moment, the CDC only recommends masks for medical professionals, and hospitals are running out. Those in the medical field, Cowen says, "are the ones willing to pay the most," and higher prices might cut down on frivolous buying by the general public. Higher prices are also a signal to manufacturers to make more masks.   There are obviously downsides to higher prices. Merchants are profiteering on fear, and higher prices mean only the more affluent can afford masks. "There is a genuine, legitimate fairness concern," Cowen says.   A majority of states around the country have laws against price gouging. California's, for example, forbids raising prices by more than ten percent if the governor has declared an emergency. We found no reports yet of these laws being applied to masks. According to most economists, setting a ceiling on mask prices would only add to the problem: "If you keep the price artificially low, there ends up being a shortage, not enough in the market," says Cowen.   It's not just politicians who are concerned about the optics of price gouging. Amazon, for example, has a policy urging "fair pricing." In recent weeks, it's told some sellers of masks on its marketplace that they could be suspended if they jack up their prices too much. "There is no place for price gouging on Amazon," says a company spokesperson. "We are disappointed that bad actors are attempting to artificially raise prices on basic need products during a global health crisis and, in line with our long-standing policy, have recently blocked or removed tens of thousands of offers."  Amazon's policy might seem strange, considering it's a profit-hungry corporation that uses fancy algorithms to increase prices all the time. But a famous study by Daniel Kahneman, Jack Knetsch, and Richard Thaler suggests profiteering during a calamity could hurt a company's bottom line if it results in long-lasting damage to their reputation. "Uber learned this the hard way," Thaler says, pointing to the PR damage inflicted by its use of surge pricing during Hurricane Sandy.   "Amazon doesn't want people to resent it," Cowen says. "Masks are a very small share of their overall business, but if people get upset at Amazon, the whole company could be worth less." In other words, Amazon has an economic interest in not appearing cold-hearted in times like this. For Cowen, the solution to the mask shortage is letting the market set the price. "Arguably, it would be better for the country and the world to let the price of the masks go higher. But Amazon is selfishly preserving its reputation."   As for Daniel Tamasi, he ended up getting his masks. He paid $50 for a box. But they were the wrong masks! "I later found out that these might not actually be super effective against coronavirus," he says. He did not get an N95 respirator mask, which has a close facial fit and blocks around 95 percent of airborne particles. The CDC recommends using an N95 or higher level respirator mask to prevent the spread of coronavirus, but, again, this recommendation is currently only for health professionals. On Saturday, the U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams put it bluntly on Twitter: "Seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS!"  Did you enjoy this newsletter? Well, it looks even better in your inbox!

Supreme Court Eyes The President's Power To Say 'You're Fired!',https://www.npr.org/2020/03/03/810322976/supreme-court-eyes-the-presidents-power-to-say-you-re-fired,March 3, 2020, At the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday, the Trump administration is seeking to make it easier for the president to call in the heads of the nation's independent agencies and say those words he was famous for on TV: "You're fired!" In particular, the administration is asking the court to restrict or reverse a decision that dates back nearly a century and that has been repeatedly reaffirmed. In the short run, the fate of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau hangs in the balance. In the long run, so too could the fate of independent regulatory agencies that have long governed everything from monetary policy to public health and safety. A new watchdog for a broken system In 2008, the U.S. economy was on the brink of financial disaster. Following nearly two decades of deregulation, U.S. banks had been offering home loans to people with poor credit, overleveraging and engaging in widespread, excessive lending practices, resulting in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

 Richard Cordray, the CFPB's first director In 2010, Congress sought to reestablish oversight and regulation of the financial system. Among the remedies enacted was a law that consolidated the consumer protection powers of seven agencies into one — the CFPB. Placed in the offices of the Federal Reserve and funded directly by the Fed, the new agency was charged with protecting consumers and preventing a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. "The CFPB had two roles. One was to try to prevent an economic collapse of that kind ever happening again, and that was done largely through putting in place rules that safeguarded the mortgage market and ferreted out a lot of the irresponsible and ultimately failed lending that had occurred," says Richard Cordray, the first director of the CFPB. The other, he says, was "to protect consumers." Once in place, the bureau moved aggressively to protect consumers from bad actors in the banking and financial services sector. A prime example was the crackdown on Wells Fargo. The bank faced heavy fines for creating an estimated 3.5 million fake deposit accounts and fake credit cards in the names of people who didn't authorize them and for improperly repossessing the cars of military personnel. Also in the CFPB's sights — bill collectors, telemarketers and others accused of misleading consumers. The CFPB under fire Among those facing scrutiny — Seila Law, a law firm in California, which was under investigation on allegations that it charged consumers illegal upfront fees for debt relief services and that it deceived consumers about those services with misleading advertising and marketing material. As part of its investigation, the CFPB issued a letter to Seila demanding documents. The firm refused to comply, contending that the structure of the agency is unconstitutional because its director cannot be fired "at will" by the president. Instead, the bureau's director, like the leaders of other independent federal agencies, can only be fired by the president "for cause" — specifically, inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance. Seila lost that argument in the lower courts, but now the Supreme Court will take a crack at the case. Tuesday's arguments will center on a longstanding Supreme Court decision that forms the basis for all independent federal agencies. In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt fired William Humphrey, one of five commissioners on the Federal Trade Commission. Roosevelt didn't have a problem with Humphrey's job performance. The sole reason for the dismissal was that Humphrey had been appointed by the previous president, Republican Herbert Hoover, and was a conservative who disagreed with Roosevelt's policy views. Because the FTC had oversight over many progressive New Deal policies, Roosevelt wanted Humphrey replaced with his own appointee. The Supreme Court ruled in 1935 unanimously that the president could not dismiss FTC commissioners the way he could his own Cabinet or other members of his administration. It said that Congress had created the FTC to perform quasi-judicial, quasi-legislative functions and therefore intended it to be politically independent. The Humphrey decision has been reaffirmed dozens of times since it was decided 85 years ago. On Tuesday, however, Seila Law and the Trump administration will argue that the Humphrey decision does not apply to the CFPB. They say the bureau is different because its power rests in the hands of a single director, as opposed to a multimember commission. Preserving executive power It is an argument that is likely to find support among the five conservative members of the current court. Before joining the court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh in particular took issue with the Humphrey decision repeatedly. But he is not alone, Justice Neil Gorsuch believes that the executive has been unconstitutionally weakened by a surplus of independent regulatory agencies and executive branch officials that are beyond the president's control. Justice Samuel Alito expressed similar views before joining the court, saying of the presidency, "the president has not just some executive powers, but the executive power — the whole thing." Supporting that view is much of the business community. 
                Andrew Pincus argues that the CFPB's single-director structure makes it different from the multimember independent agencies in much of the nation's regulatory structure.

 Andrew Pincus argues that the CFPB's single-director structure makes it different from the multimember independent agencies in much of the nation's regulatory structure. "The theory of our government is that the popularly elected president will appoint officials and remove them if they're not doing what he wants," says Andrew Pincus, who wrote a brief on behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in this case. "If you take away the president's power to remove someone, then you're drastically limiting" the president's "political accountability." Pincus argues that the CFPB's single-director structure makes it different from the multimember independent agencies that dominate much of the nation's regulatory structure. Multimember agencies are required to have people from different parties, he observes. The president picks the chairman "who has a lot of control about how [the agency] operates. The terms are staggered, so most presidents will have an opportunity to appoint a number of those people." And the very fact that they are multimember agencies means there has to be a majority in order to act. All of that, Pincus says, "is a check on the exercise of government power" and none of those features exists when an agency has a single director. The Chamber of Commerce has not asked the court to go further than distinguishing between the CFPB and agencies governed by a multimember board. The Trump administration, however, is willing to go all the way, telling the court that if need be, it should reverse the 1935 Humphrey decision and make all independent federal agencies completely subservient to the president. No government defense for the CFPB Typically, the Department of Justice defends federal agencies facing legal challenges. But the Trump administration agrees with Seila Law, meaning there was nobody to defend the CFPB in this case. So, the Supreme Court appointed former Solicitor General Paul Clement, a noted conservative, to argue on behalf of the bureau. 
                Attorney Paul Clement warns the CFPB case risks unraveling the dozens of regulatory federal agencies.

 Attorney Paul Clement warns the CFPB case risks unraveling the dozens of regulatory federal agencies. The Constitution says nothing about the president's power to remove officers who have been confirmed by the Senate, observes Clement. And he points out that the CFPB's single-director structure is not unique among independent federal agencies. Among those with a single director are the Comptroller of the Currency and the Social Security Administration. "The issue in this case is like the thread on the sweater that if you start tugging on it, and you tug on it hard enough, potentially, the whole sweater comes undone," he says. "The sweater here really is ... the whole alphabet soup of agencies that all have these for-cause protections." Start to unravel the sweater in the CFPB case, he contends, and you may well end up unraveling the dozens of federal agencies that regulate everything from the nation's health and safety to its monetary policy, including the dozens of agencies that are governed by multimember commissions. "The Federal Reserve is a great example of why Congress imposes these kinds of restrictions," so as to protect some of our most important institutions from destabilizing political crosscurrents, Clement says. The Trump administration, however, is willing to roll the dice. It argues that if a single-member agency cannot be distinguished from a multimember agency, the court should reverse the 85-year-old Humphrey decision, and all of the decisions that followed it. That would throw into doubt not just the CFPB, but also independent agencies that make up roughly a third of the government — and, potentially, the rules and regulations that those agencies have laid down over the years. The end of independent agencies? Former CFPB Director Cordray cautions against that approach. He points out that even the Mortgage Bankers Association filed a brief in this case, saying, "Whatever you do, don't strike down the agency as a whole because it would cause chaos in the mortgage market. The rules that are in place, we've all adjusted to those, those are working well." The Supreme Court majority likely would want to avoid a decision that causes chaos. But the conservative court majority is made up of five justices who, to one degree or another, have indicated a hostility to the notion of independent agencies. The question is, how far do they want to go?

 Choosing between renting or buying a home? Here are six things to think about as you make the decision. Updated Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET Most Americans say they aspire to homeownership. As mortgage rates near record lows, buying may become more appealing — and accessible. But how do you know if homeownership is right for you or whether you should continue renting? In this episode, we help you weigh the pros and cons of renting versus owning. Of course there are some tools out there to help you decide, like a rent vs. buy calculator. (Here are a few we recommend: Trulia, NYT's The Upshot, Freddie Mac). But the decision to purchase or rent is about way more than just money. We walk you through six things to consider as you're making the decision.  1. Keep in mind: Owning a home is the No. 1 way most Americans build wealth. The average net worth of a homeowner is much larger than that of a renter, says Alanna McCargo, vice president for housing finance policy at the Urban Institute. In 2016, the average homeowner's net worth was $231,420; the average net worth of a renter was $5,200. "Families have built wealth for generations and financial security over time as a result of their owning a home," McCargo says. Building wealth through home equity is a huge factor to consider as you think about whether you want to rent or own. 2. Buying a house is not an automatic ticket to the good life, and it may not make you happier. If you take wealth accumulation out of the equation, research hasn't shown definitively that buying a home makes people happier, says Elizabeth Dunn, a professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia. She studies how time, money and technology shape human happiness. "You know, if anything, homeowners seem to experience a little bit more pain from their homes," Dunn says. Renters don't have to fix the water heater when it breaks, make sure their mailbox matches the other ones in the neighborhood, replace the roof every 15 years. The costs of homeownership go well beyond the monthly mortgage payment, says Michelle Singletary, a personal finance author and columnist with The Washington Post. "I'm still a big believer in homeownership — obviously, I've been a homeowner since my second year out of college," Singletary says. "I just believe that you need to take it slow, understand what it means." 3. Renting gives you flexibility. Renters have one definite benefit over owners: It's a lot easier to pick up and move, whether to escape noisy neighbors or follow a job offer across the country. Especially when you're younger, Dunn says, you may be happier having the flexibility to travel and teach English in Thailand and pursue other adventures like that, rather than spend money and time dealing with plumbing problems and leaky roofs. 4. The flexibility of renting comes with a cost: Rent will always go up. Inflation alone pushes rents up over time — and if the neighborhood gets trendy, monthly rents can go through the roof. But if you own your home (and you have a fixed-rate mortgage, which means your interest rates won't change over the life of your mortgage), your monthly payment is a fixed cost. McCargo says that this offers peace of mind. And as inflation rises, living in your home gets effectively cheaper over the long term. "Not to mention, every single month, you're paying something down every time you make that mortgage payment," says McCargo, thereby building your equity in your home and reducing your debt load. 5. You don't need a big down payment to own a home. Homeownership might have a lower price of entry than you think. A 20% down payment was once standard, but McCargo says the average today is 5% of the total.  Keep in mind that if you put down less than 20%, you'll likely have to pay a monthly private mortgage insurance (PMI). This can add hundreds to your monthly payments. On many loans, you can request to cancel the PMI once you have a loan to value ratio of 80% (meaning the home is worth 20% more than you owe.) The lender should cancel PMI automatically once the ratio reaches 78%. The exception is with FHA loans, where PMI is permanent unless you refinance. First-time buyers can find programs that offer mortgages with even lower down payments. Some cities offer grants to help with down payments to encourage people to invest in their communities. A good place to go to find out about such incentives is your state's housing finance agency. 6. Owning a home can give you a sense of security — and that can be priceless. Singletary was surprised by the profound sense of both security and accomplishment she felt from buying her own place. "I had been raised by my grandmother, and the circumstances in which I came to live with her were not great," she says. "I was thinking, 'Wow, this is super cool — that this kid who was thrown away and almost ended up in foster care, here she is, at 22. I own my own home.' It was a great deal of satisfaction and pride that I had done this, against all odds." We'd love to hear from you.

Mortgage Rates Are Near All-Time Lows As Coronavirus Worries Hit Markets,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/02/811223836/mortgage-rates-are-near-all-time-lows-as-coronavirus-worries-hit-markets,March 2, 2020,

 Coronavirus fears sent stock markets plummeting last week, but they're also pushing mortgage rates down near historical lows. That's an opportunity for homebuyers and homeowners. A dramatic drop in mortgage rates may give prospective homebuyers a chance to afford the house they've been eyeing — or may lower monthly payments for homeowners who refinance. Last week, fears over the novel coronavirus outbreak's anticipated economic impact sparked the most dramatic stock market sell-off since the 2008 financial crisis. Stocks rallied Monday on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to boost the economy. But there's a silver lining in this market mayhem for homeowners and homebuyers: Mortgage rates have been driven down to near all-time lows.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Mortgages tend to rise and fall with 10-year Treasury yields. So nervous investors piling into bonds have helped push down mortgage rates, which have fallen about a full percentage point over the past year. That's a good thing, says Laurie Goodman, co-director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute. She says that buying a home is crucial for most Americans to build wealth and that these lower rates can mean hundreds or thousands of dollars a year in lower mortgage payments. "Homeownership is really the single best way to build wealth," Goodman says. The median homeowner has a net worth of around $230,000 — nearly half of that is in the form of equity in their home, she says. Meanwhile, Goodman adds, the median renter has total wealth of less than $5,000. If you have good credit, rates on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage have dropped from about 4.5% to around 3.5% over the past year. Goodman says that this effectively makes the same-priced house from a year ago more than 10% cheaper today in monthly mortgage payments. So, she says, someone who was on the fence a year ago about whether they could afford to own a home "is going to find it very attractive at this time." Millions of people around the country who are already homeowners could probably save money on their monthly payment by refinancing. But it can be a little tricky to figure out if that's worth doing. Elysia Stobbe works in the mortgage industry and is the author of the book How to Get Approved for the Best Mortgage Without Sticking a Fork in Your Eye. "People see rates are low or rates are dropping, so we get a lot of calls," she says. "People just want us to run the numbers and make sure it makes sense." Stobbe says that on a $300,000 30-year fixed-rate loan, if you were at 4.5% and refinanced at 3.5%, that would save you about $2,000 a year in mortgage payments. So that sounds pretty good. "Yes, the monthly savings is great," she says, "but what are the fees involved?" Stobbe says the fees vary a lot from state to state. In Florida, you might have to pay thousands of dollars more than in Virginia or Georgia, she says. So she says you want to think about how long it will take to break even on paying those fees before you actually save any money. And there's one last very important thing to consider, especially if you've been paying your mortgage for a long time, say five or 10 years. When you get a new 30-year loan, you go back to year one on your payments. That matters a lot because in those early years you're paying much more interest than you are principal. So you're not paying down what you owe on the house that much. "Absolutely," Stobbe says, "on any loan, the interest is front-loaded." Think about this like eating a sandwich. The mayonnaise is the interest you pay the bank. The meat is the principal — the amount that goes toward building equity and actually owning more of your home. The first couple of years on a new 30-year loan, you're basically eating a mayonnaise sandwich. It's mostly interest. So you probably don't want to go back there. Stobbe says many lenders will structure a 25-year or 20-year loan so you don't have to go all the way back to square one. And if you can afford to refinance into a 15-year loan, she says, that's even better. "The shorter term, you're plugging away at that principal much quicker than the longer 30-year fixed," Stobbe says.

 The El Capitan monolith in Yosemite National Park. Climber Alex Honnold scaled the rock formation in under four hours with nearly no equipment, as seen in the 2018 documentary Free Solo. In 2017, American rock climber Alex Honnold ascended Yosemite National Park's vertical rock formation, El Capitan, in under four hours. Honnold's extraordinary journey to the top was captured in the documentary Free Solo, named after the method of climbing without ropes or equipment which Honnold used.  While audiences largely reacted to the movie with nail-biting, dizzying fascination, economist John Cochrane thought to himself, "Why wasn't this done 150 years ago?" On today's show, the three economic lessons that prompted his question, and the surprising links between rock climbing and economics. Music by Drop Electric.

 Jack Welch served as General Electric's chief executive from 1981 to 2001. During his reign, the company's market value skyrocketed to $410 billion from $12 billion. Updated at 5:08 p.m. ET Jack Welch, the larger-than-life chief executive who grew General Electric into an industrial powerhouse, has died. He was 84. During his reign from 1981 to 2001, the company's market value skyrocketed to $410 billion from $12 billion. For his success in growing GE's value, Fortune magazine dubbed him "manager of the century" in 1999. Welch aggressively bought and sold divisions, insisting GE rank near the top of any business in which it operated. But his style of management came under a lot of scrutiny and criticism after he left. Welch was known as "Neutron Jack" for cutting tens of thousands of jobs, and critics say the seeds of GE's downfall were planted under his tenure. "Today is a sad day for the entire GE family," company Chairman and CEO H. Lawrence Culp Jr. said in a statement Monday. "Jack was larger than life and the heart of GE for half a century. He reshaped the face of our company and the business world. "When I last saw him, what I remember most vividly was when he asked me, 'So how exactly are you running the company?' Jack was still in it — committed to GE's success." "There was no corporate leader like 'neutron' Jack," President Trump wrote in a tweet. "He will never be forgotten."  "Jack was brilliant, with historic contributions to global commerce," wrote Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, president of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute.   He noted that another CEO — Colgate-Palmolive's Reuben Mark — managed even bigger business gains during the late decades of the 20th century, but lacked Welch's talent for self-promotion. Welch's legacy has grown more complicated in the two decades since his retirement. GE has struggled, and its market value today is about a quarter of what it was at its peak. "The question I think that we have to look at today was the value short-term value or was it real value that was ultimately mismanaged," said Charles Elson, professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. Welch also triggered an Securities and Exchange Commission investigation with his multi-million-dollar retirement package, which included country club memberships and use of a corporate jet. He ultimately gave up those perks.  "It was overreaching and not only offensive to the investors in GE, but I think offensive to the public in general," Elson said.  GE was one of the 12 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average when it was created in 1896, but it was booted from the blue chip index in 2018.

 The historic Colorado Fuel and Iron Company furnace stands in Pueblo, Colo. Mills like this one gave this place its nickname, Steel City. Today only about 6% of the city's jobs are in manufacturing. Unlike postcard mountain resort towns, or the booming, high-tech corridor centered around Denver, Pueblo is Colorado's faded industrial relic. A city struggling to redefine its economy, and its politics following decades as a solidly blue-collar Democratic stronghold.  Pueblo is a two-hour drive south from Denver, through prosperous Colorado Springs with its military bases, defense contractors and megachurches. Wide open plains stretch for miles, mountains off in the distance. And then, popping up out of the horizon, stark vertical lines: Smokestacks from the mill that gave this place its nickname, Steel City. Today only about 6% of Pueblo's jobs are in manufacturing after a decades-long decline.  Loading...  Old timers like Rod Slyhoff remember the day everything changed, back in 1984.  "It's in my mind all the time," said Slyhoff, president and CEO of the Pueblo Chamber of Commerce.  "I believe it was in March, 6,500 pink slips were issued to the [steel mill company] employees," Slyhoff said. "And our economy changed drastically in one day." President Trump has promised to bring steel back, and made American manufacturing a big focus of his administration.  
                Rod Slyhoff is the president and CEO of the Pueblo Chamber of Commerce. He remembers when 6,500 steel mill workers were fired in 1984. The city's economy was drastically changed in one day.

 Rod Slyhoff is the president and CEO of the Pueblo Chamber of Commerce. He remembers when 6,500 steel mill workers were fired in 1984. The city's economy was drastically changed in one day. Just last week, Trump held a rally about 45 minutes up the road in Colorado Springs. "Remember they said you can't do manufacturing jobs anymore? Really? Tell me about it," he said to cheers from the packed arena. "Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over one half a century." Trump's promises sound good to Slyhoff. "I think his statements to me are very positive for the business and manufacturing community because it shows that we have a president that's interested and knows that industry," Slyhoff said. "It's that attitude that you've got a leader that is really aware of the value of manufacturing, where I think we felt like maybe that hasn't been a priority for previous presidents."

 A person walks across a bridge over the Arkansas River in Pueblo. The city is aiming to redefine its economy, and its politics following decades as a solidly blue collar Democratic stronghold. And he worries it may not be a priority for the next president, if he or she is a Democrat. While it's true that unemployment is down and the stock market has been up for the last few years, in Pueblo working people feel like they can't catch a break. This city of 111,750 has only added about 5,000 jobs since 2008, and median income has barely budged since then.  Today the steel mill, now owned by a Russian company. doesn't have the 24-7 stream of workers that it used to. "Quite a slap in the face"

Today the steel mill, now owned by a Russian company, doesn't have the 24-7 stream of workers that it used to. At the mill's gate stands Chuck Perko, president of United Steelworkers Union Local 3267, which represents some of the workers at this sprawling, 2-mile-wide industrial site.  He's wearing a union t-shirt in cold weather and a baseball cap. A sign at the visitor's center says: "140 years steel strong." The mill goes back to 1882, Perko said, but it's a fraction of the fiery, smoke-belching heart of the city it once was when steel jobs drew immigrant labor from all over the world.

 A union charter inside the United Steelworkers headquarters. Perko says that the steel mill in Pueblo dates back to 1882. "It's now 10% of the workforce," Perko said, meaning 90% of the jobs at the mill are now gone. At his union hall about a mile from the mill, there's an antique Pepsi machine and an out-of-tune piano. He told me some of his union members went to that Trump rally in Colorado Springs. "People need that little bit of hope," he said, "even if it doesn't take much of a delve to realize that what he's saying is not what he intends to do. The message is good, but it's not gonna be backed up by anything that is going to be good for your job." He says he was surprised Trump narrowly won this area in 2016. "I mean, this has been a labor stronghold going back to the 1930s," he said, "when labor came into its own. And so it was quite a slap in the face."  
                Chuck Perko is the fourth generation in his family to work in the steel mill. He didn't finish college but now he says it's more difficult to find a good blue collar job in Pueblo.

Perko is the fourth generation of his family to work at the mill. He didn't finish college, but that didn't keep him from getting a good job. Now, he says, you have to be pretty lucky to get a good blue-collar job in Pueblo.  "One of the things that you see written on a lot of the new hardhats is '#millmoney,' because it's still one of the best paying jobs for somebody out there that may not necessarily have a college degree," he said.  Pueblo is 50% Hispanic. The Arkansas River that bisects the town was once the border with Mexico. But the steel mill and nearby coal mines attracted immigrants from all over the world for generations. Perko says his team at the mill has 20 nationalities now, and they take pride in what they do.

 "The steelworkers, when somebody sees someone in that orange jacket walking around, they know there's someone that's providing for their family," he said.  A "steel city" no more The phrase "steel city" is still all over Pueblo, on restaurants and bars, but that is no longer the reality of the economy here.  People are far more likely to work at the local hospital, or in the relatively new clean energy or legal marijuana industries. (Local governments can bar marijuana grow houses and retail in Colorado. Unlike neighboring Colorado Springs, Pueblo has embraced the sector.) Other big employers are government, retail and food service.

 Kevin Roark has bartended at Eilers Place on and off for a decade. Perko, the steelworkers union president, sympathizes with people working low-wage service jobs. "When I hear someone say, that job at McDonalds, they don't deserve to make even $12 an hour because they should pick themselves up by their bootstraps and go do something else — those people work harder than I do," Perko said. "I'll be the first to admit it. They deserve to be paid for their labor." That sounds like something a Bernie Sanders supporter would say. That's because he is.  Perko used to like Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar, and Elizabeth Warren.  "They're all people that either have a blue-collar background or have at least a plan for the working class," he said. "I cannot get behind the parts of the Democratic party that feel like corporate America." When the steel mill laid off all those workers in the 1980s, a group of churches got together to open a food pantry called the Cooperative Care Center, and it's still open today, offering bags of food, clothes, medicine and toiletries.

 Louie Bran worked at the steel plants in Pueblo until he was laid off in the 1980s. He never returned to work there, and instead laid bricks in the city until he retired. But the clients aren't laid off steelworkers anymore.  "It's the middle class now that are hurting," said Mona Montoya, the director here for 27 years.  "We've seen people from the police department, the fire department, school teachers, nurses," Montoya said. "You close your eyes and you think of a homeless person - they're families, and that's where it really pains us, to see that kind of deal." One morning this week, there were a lot of families waiting for help. Like 68-year-old Nancy Mestas, Pueblo born and raised.  Mestas lives with her disabled adult daughter and two grandkids.  After 20 years working as a librarian, now she's retired and says her family can't afford enough food to get through the month.  "For my daughter they give her a certain amount of food stamps, and she tries to stretch it as much as she can, but sometimes it doesn't go as far as it should," Mestas said.  She believes a president could fix things, but everybody seems too invested in fighting their political opponents. "Bad mouthing each other instead of taking into consideration what really matters," she said.  Mestas says she hasn't decided who she'll support for president. "I don't like anybody who's running. I used to be Republican," she said, "but now at this point in time I'm unaffiliated."

 A neighborhood near Pueblo's historic steelworks. The Cooperative Care Center helped 38,000 people last year. That's about a quarter of the local population.  Not surprising, since a quarter of the people in Pueblo live at or below the federal poverty line.  A lot of the food at the Center distributes is donated by grocery stores. Like the one Don Sena has spent his life stocking the shelves of on the overnight shift. "I've been in the grocery business over 50 years," he said at a bar near the steel mill where his father used to work. He was pouring a Dos Equis beer into a glass of tomato juice.  Sena is proud he put his daughter through college, and that his son is a drill instructor in the Marines.  He's about to retire. Many would say he's lived the American dream. But Sena isn't feeling too good about it.  "There ain't no jobs in this town any more," he said. "There ain't none. If you have a job, you're lucky." Working class people are struggling, he says, and rich people are taking advantage of them.  "A place where people make things"

Ina Bernard, an artist from Germany, welcomes me to Artisan Textile Company, a shop she opened four years ago in an old part of the city. Her shop carries handmade items like mittens and paintings, and offers classes in knitting and card making.  She loves Pueblo. "It's just a really fun small-town community, lovely location," she said. "The weather is beautiful, lots of sunshine. Also the mountains." Making artisan textiles may seem like the opposite of manufacturing the commodity Pueblo became known as Steel City for. But to Bernard, the growing artists' community is not a sharp break from the industrial past.

 Brues Alehouse Brewing Company in Pueblo. The city is seeing a growing artists' community and small businesses are setting up shop. "I think Pueblo is very proud to be a steel city town because that's really what helped build it up. That's why people came here," she said. "But I think Pueblo is now kind of looking at maybe growing from that, and definitely being supportive of the creative economy." Bernard says just like immigrants a century ago, she moved to Pueblo to be in a place where people make things. 
Jack Dorsey, Twitter's Eccentric CEO, Could Be Looking For A Job Soon,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/01/810979699/jack-dorsey-twitters-eccentric-ceo-could-be-looking-for-a-job-soon,March 1, 2020,

 Jack Dorsey's dual roles as CEO of Twitter and Square is drawing pressure from an activist investor, which is pushing for changes at the social media company. Jack Dorsey isn't your regular CEO. He often says and does things that raise eyebrows. Now, one large investor has had enough. The powerful hedge fund Elliott Management has bought a sizable stake in Twitter in hopes of bringing change to the social media company. Elliott is concerned that Dorsey hasn't focused enough on Twitter, because he is also chief executive of payments company Square. The hedge fund is pushing for a CEO whose sole job is running Twitter. Adding pressure, Elliott has nominated four directors to the company's board, according to two people familiar with the matter. The two sides have had constructive talks, according to the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Twitter and Elliott declined to comment. The worry is that under Dorsey's leadership, Twitter is not poised to capitalize on a flood of news this year, including the U.S. presidential election, the summer Olympic Games in Tokyo and the coronavirus outbreak, that could attract people and advertisers to the platform. The soft-spoken Dorsey has brought attention to himself for many things beyond his unusual twin CEO jobs, which have him splitting his time between Twitter and Square. He recently tweeted that he is moving to Africa for three to six months in 2020. He told Wired Magazine he eats just one meal a day and tries to spend two hours a day meditating. In 2018, he got a lot of criticism over a silent meditation retreat he went on in Myanmar. He tweeted that during the 10-day "vipassana" retreat, he stayed away from "devices, reading, writing, physical excercise (sic), music, intoxicants, meat, talking, or even eye contact." For my birthday this year, I did a 10-day silent vipassana meditation, this time in Pyin Oo Lwin, Myanmar 🇲🇲. We went into silence on the night of my birthday, the 19th. Here’s what I know 👇🏼 As Dorsey tweets about his life choices, investors have become restless about whether he's the right CEO to lead Twitter. The company has struggled to grow its business at the same pace as its biggest competitors in Silicon Valley. That includes the much-larger Facebook, as well as newer apps like Snapchat and TikTok that are popular with young people. While Twitter has hundreds of millions of users and is popular among celebrities, the media and political figures, notably President Donald Trump, critics say it has been slow to innovate. It has also struggled with misinformation and handling abusive users and trolls. Twitter's quarterly revenue, mainly from ads, passed $1 billion for the first time at the end of last year. Facebook, by contrast, reported $21 billion in sales in the same quarter, and has billions of users. Twitter's shares are worth less now than they were when Dorsey returned as CEO in 2015. He was the company's founding CEO, but left in 2008 after a falling out with another co-founder. "I think product development has been anemic," said Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at NYU who bought Twitter shares because he thought it was undervalued. "I think their business model is flawed, But more than anything, you know, the lowest lying fruit here is to find a full time CEO." Dorsey's Africa plans spurred Galloway to write a letter to Twitter's board in December calling on them to replace Dorsey. Galloway said he never got a response, and has since sold all his shares. Sad to be leaving the continent…for now. Africa will define the future (especially the bitcoin one!). Not sure where yet, but I’ll be living here for 3-6 months mid 2020. Grateful I was able to experience a small part. 🌍 pic.twitter.com/9VqgbhCXWd In Elliott, Twitter faces a much more formidable antagonist. The hedge fund manages nearly $40 billion in assets and has made a name for itself taking on big companies. It has successfully pushed for changes at eBay and AT&T, and it recently took a stake in SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate. "Elliott is pretty notorious for being activist," said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. "Their history has been to pick battles that they think they can win."

 President Trump takes questions at a press conference with, from left, National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, Vice President Mike Pence and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield. Last week, even as he responded to growing fears about coronavirus, President Trump had his eye on the markets. At the start of what turned out to be a terrible week for stock prices, Trump tweeted that coronavirus was "very much under control" and implied that stock market losses were overdone. The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me! But by the end of the week, Trump was decidedly less sanguine. It turned out to be the worst week for U.S. stocks since the 2008 financial crisis. "Well, I think it's just people don't know. It's the unknown," Trump said of the market reaction to coronavirus. "You know they look at it and they say, 'How long would this last?' " More than any other president in recent memory, Trump has tied his fate to the stock market. He has tweeted about it more than 140 times since taking office and has made stock price gains a key part of his reelection pitch, often inflating the gains as he did in a video just released by the White House on Feb. 22. pic.twitter.com/tOBcudSlcl "The stock market is up 80%, in some cases much higher than that," Trump said. "401(k)s are at record levels." But if you look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average, it was up by 56% on Feb. 22, compared with the date of Trump's election. Some of those gains were erased in the past week.  
                Markets have climbed since the 2016 election but have seen a sharp drop in the past week because of fears coronavirus will hurt the global economy.

 On Friday night, at a rally in South Carolina, Trump didn't mention the stock market, which is quite a change from his norm. In recent months, he has boasted about market records at rallies.  "And we've set 144 records on the stock market in three years — 144 records!" Trump said in Phoenix last month. He brought it up in his State of the Union address, and even at the National Prayer Breakfast, telling attendees, "For those of you that are interested in stocks, it looks like the stock market will be way up again today." His prediction proved accurate that day.  Trump even has a riff he does at rallies about a man he calls Henry whose wife has been wowed by the performance of his 401(k). Trump quotes him as saying that his wife thinks he's a genius and loves him again. "Shows what money can do, right?" Trump joked at the Phoenix rally. It's easy to get caught up in the exuberance of a rising market, said Matt McDonald, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies, a political and economic consulting firm. "If the parade is going, there's a high temptation to just get in front of the parade," McDonald said. "The problem is, live by the markets, die by the markets — and we just went into correction territory the other day."

 Traders at the New York Stock Exchange react at the end of the worst week on Wall Street since 2008. A correction is market losses of more than 10% over a short period of time. And that's exactly what happened last week. The Dow set another record last Thursday: the largest point drop ever in a single day. Trump isn't boasting about that one.  White House officials are running through options for what to do if coronavirus infects the broader economy as well, including tax cuts. For now, economic adviser Larry Kudlow is urging calm. "I just think everybody — whether you are an investor or whether you're an ordinary Main Street person — people should not overreact," Kudlow told reporters.

 Larry Kudlow, Trump's top economic adviser, speaks to reporters at the White House on Friday. Market movements aren't a particularly meaningful economic indicator. But McDonald said they are something consumers see on a regular basis, along with gas prices.  "For presidents, they want to be careful about taking responsibility for things that they can't entirely control," said McDonald. While the president can't control stock prices, he does have the responsibility for how he and his administration respond to coronavirus — something he acknowledged on Saturday after announcing the first U.S. death from the virus. How coronavirus plays out in the coming weeks and months and the Trump administration's response to it could have a lot more bearing on the president's reelection chances than what is happening on Wall Street.  "Safety, health — No. 1," Trump said, after explaining that further restricting travel could hurt companies like airlines. "The markets will take care of themselves."

 Trader Joe's founder Joe Coulombe, seen around 1985 in Pasadena, Calif., died Friday at the age of 89. The idea, when stated simply, doesn't exactly scream "grocery empire." Yet that's just what became of the maritime-themed specialty market that Joe Coulombe first opened in 1967 in Pasadena, Calif. — which, in the decades that followed, blossomed into a web of hundreds of locations in dozens of states. On Friday, more than three decades after he retired from the chain that still bears his name, Coulombe died in Pasadena at the age of 89. The company confirmed his death to NPR in an email Saturday. "Joe was the perfect person at the right time for Trader Joe's. He was a brilliant thinker with a mesmerizing personality that simply galvanized all with whom he worked," CEO Dan Bane said in a statement included with the announcement. "He was not only our founder, he was our first spokesperson. He starred in captivating radio ads for years, always signing off with his unique, 'thanks for listening.' Joe developed a cadre of leaders that carried on his vision and helped shape Trader Joe's in the early years." Those early years began with a modest series of convenience stores by the name of Pronto, which the Rexall drugstore chain had tasked Coulombe with operating in Los Angeles in the late 1950s. Within several years, he had purchased Pronto for his own — but soon found his cluster of stores confronted with a push from 7-Eleven, which he described in 2011 as the "800-pound gorilla of convenience stores." "So," he told the Los Angeles Times in 2011, "I had to do something different." He recalled seeing statistics that education levels in the U.S. were booming, and that gave him an idea: Why not cater to this better-educated, better-traveled — but still modestly salaried — class of customer? "All Trader Joe's were located near centers of learning. Pasadena, where I opened the first one, was because Pasadena is the epitome of a well-educated town," he explained. "I reframed this: Trader Joe's is for overeducated and underpaid people, for all the classical musicians, museum curators, journalists — that's why we've always had good press, frankly!" As for that nautical theme, well, Coulombe really leaned in. "I read that the [Boeing] 747 [aircraft] would radically reduce the cost of travel, and I came up with the term 'Trader' to evoke the South Seas. The first stores were loaded with marine artifacts. We'd go down to the docks in San Pedro, we'd buy flags, chains, all that stuff. I [put] walk-in boxes in the shape of ships with cannon in the middle of the stores," he adds. "That was a terrible idea." Coulombe and the fledgling company went one step further in 1972, launching the Trader Joe's label and slapping quirky names on healthy, relatively low-priced foods such as granola, the company's first private-label product. And then, of course, there was also eventually the famously cheap Charles Shaw wine — perhaps better known by the nickname "two-buck Chuck" in California. There were other local wines in stock too, of course. "I accidentally created the world's largest assortment of Californian wine. In 1967 nobody was interested in wine, let alone Californian wines," he recalled in a 2005 interview with Coriolis Research. "We were the first to give shelf space to what later became known as boutique Californian wineries." Beth Kowitt, who reported on the company for Fortune magazine, explained the company's process to NPR in 2010. "They buy directly from producers whenever possible, which takes out a lot of costs. So there are no middlemen involved. So they're not going through distributors," Kowitt said. "Also, because they're buying in such large volume, they can secure large discounts from producers." In the end, the names, the types of products, the exotic decor — it continued to have a particular consumer in mind. "All this stuff aimed at the subliminal," Coulombe said in 2005, "so that when the well-educated person walks down the aisle they know, without anything shouting at them, they know that they are in an outlet aimed at the well educated person."  He sold his stake in the company to the owner of Aldi Nord, a German grocery chain, in 1979, though he stayed on as chief executive until finally retiring from Trader Joe's in 1988. The company now boasts more than 500 stores in 42 states and the District of Columbia.

 Workers wear protective face masks at the Yanfeng Adient factory in Shanghai, where car seats are assembled, on Feb. 24. As new cases of coronavirus infection slow in China, the country is gradually getting back to work. Authorities and businesses are taking a range of measures: Local governments are chartering buses for workers. Some companies are buying out entire hotels to house quarantined staff. A temporarily shuttered movie studio is even loaning employees to factories that are short on labor. Strict quarantine measures designed to stop the spread of the new coronavirus prevented nearly 300 million migrant workers from returning to their jobs, shutting down one of the largest economies in the world for nearly three weeks and paralyzing global supply chains. Now the government is advising local officials to balance seemingly contradictory mandates: use all methods possible to limit the further spread of a deadly new virus while meeting annual economic growth targets. Earlier this month, at a top-level political meeting, China's leader Xi Jinping called for an all-out "people's war" against the deadly virus. But at the same meeting, he also urged officials to continue to "reach goals and tasks of economic and social development this year." And so, beginning last week, factories across China started slowly reopening. At least eight provinces and regions downgraded their emergency levels, loosening the most draconian restrictions on movement to allow people to leave their homes and return to work. But the biggest bottleneck continues to be a shrunken workforce, as many returning workers must be quarantined for two weeks before entering factories. A late-February survey by the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing found that 45% of firms surveyed had "no way to resume work," mostly due to labor shortages. Just 11% predicted their production capacity would reach between 80% and 100% by the end of February. China's purchasing managers' index, a measure compiled by China's state statistics agency and an industry group that measures manufacturing and service sector activity, plunged to 35.7 in February from January's 50. The index is on a 100-point scale; numbers below 50 indicate activity contracting. According to the European and German chambers of commerce, 59% of their member companies in China responding to an internal survey claimed the outbreak and China's containment measures have had a "high impact" on their businesses; 48% said they would lower their financial outlook by more than 10% for the first half of 2020.  Another survey, released Thursday by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, found that nearly a third of American firms surveyed are facing increased costs and sinking revenues as a result of disruptions to operations and travel.

 A migrant worker has his temperature taken on Feb. 25 after arriving on a chartered "point-to-point" bus from Henan, at a factory in Zouping, in China's Shandong province. Many enterprises are arranging chartered transport to enable employees to return to work. Especially for large-scale companies that are integral to global supply chains, time is of the essence. One such company is Ningbo Xusheng Auto Technology, which manufactures machine parts for European and American cars in the Chinese port city of Ningbo, in Zhejiang province. "Our clients are international, and they didn't stop operations during the outbreak. Unlike other companies who sell to Chinese clients, who all had to shut down, we really have to get back to work," Cloud Zhao, a Xusheng sales director, tells NPR. The factory is now running at 80% of its pre-virus operating capacity, Zhao says, after going through an expedited permit process with local authorities. All businesses must navigate a lengthy list of requirements to obtain permission from local authorities to reopen. First, Xusheng provided officials with a full list of employees, which in turn was vetted using "big data methods," says Zhao. Then workers had to enter their national ID numbers and phone numbers into a new provincial app created as part of virus control efforts, which identifies the cities and provinces they visited in the previous two weeks. Xusheng Auto must quarantine for two weeks anyone who spent time in a heavily infected area, before allowing them to enter the factory. To protect healthy workers, the automaker also had to show teams of inspectors that it is stocked with masks and disinfectants, and has enough space to serve as quarantine wards. Michael Chen, a manager at an electronics manufacturing plant in the neighboring province of Jiangsu, says his company has rented an entire hotel — now empty because there are no travelers — to quarantine his returning workers. His plant, normally staffed by around 2,000 workers, is back up to 70% of its pre-virus operation levels, he says, but revenues likely will only be about half what they were before the outbreak. "Our sales have been badly hit. It has been a big hassle," says Chen. "It is not that demand is actually down, but some of our supply chains are not coming back, especially if they are in Hubei province." Hubei is the epicenter of China's coronavirus outbreak, where most of the coronavirus' 2,800-plus deaths have occurred.

 Workers wear protective face masks as they sew shoe parts at the Zhejiang Xuda Shoes Co. factory in Wenzhou, China, on Feb. 27. Chen says every week he has to buy thousands of surgical masks — which now cost three times the normal price — for his workers. The city of Kunshan, where Chen works, chartered buses to ferry workers back to work, but Chen says there were not enough: "You have to mainly rely on yourself. A lot of this is outward-oriented propaganda. In reality, the measures were not enough." Last weekend, Xi gave a teleconferenced speech to 170,000 officials, promising the economic impact on would be "short-lived." China's central bank has also said it will make it easier for small- and medium-sized businesses to take out loans or repay debt, perhaps even cut taxes, but more specific measures haven't been spelled out yet. "We haven't received very specific policies of how the central or local government will support private businesses, but we trust that they are also waiting for more specific information," said Zhao, of Xusheng Auto.   Chucheng Feng, a partner in the independent research firm Plenum, says over-centralization of power in China's political system means policy can move slowly: "It takes time, province to province, to comprehend what Xi Jinping is talking about. Especially lower-ranking officials, they don't have incentives to work on their own, because the risk is if they are at odds with central policy, from central decision making, they may be purged."  Calls by the central government to ease access to loans and delay paying off corporate debts are also a sharp reversal from earlier instructions passed on to local governments. "They've been told the entire year to focus on poverty alleviation, to focus on financial de-risking, which means they were originally under the impression to lower credit," explains Feng. Even if business owners manage to secure reopening permits, widespread labor shortages are still hampering full resumption of national production. Research released this week on Henan province, a major source of migrant labor for industrial hubs like Beijing and the Pearl River Delta, indicated that only 5% of migrant workers have been able to leave. To address the labor shortfall, regional authorities are promoting a plan they've dubbed "employee-sharing," which allows firms to borrow workers from places that remain shut down. The Hengdian Group, a large private enterprise in Zhejiang province, resumed production in two of its factories in February after bringing employees from a subsidiary company — Hengdian World Studios, the world's largest film and television production site that doubles as a sprawling theme park — to work on the assembly lines. Employees who used to sell tickets at the theme park are now sorting and packing Hengdian's magnetic and lighting goods.  According to Chinese state media, over 1,000 studio workers were temporarily hired to help with factory production, including to Apeloa Pharmaceuticals, another Hengdian subsidiary. But when reached by phone, an Apeloa administrator told NPR that hadn't happened. "It would take too long to train" studio workers, he explained, "because they are unskilled and unsuitable for the technical tasks required in our factory lines."

 Google is among a growing number of American companies that are restricting employee travel as the coronavirus outbreak spreads. A Google employee in Switzerland has tested positive for the new coronavirus, as the tech giant and other American companies crack down on employee travel amid the widening outbreak. The Google employee was in its Zurich office "for a limited time" before exhibiting symptoms, the company said in a statement. "We have taken - and will continue to take - all necessary precautionary measures, following the advice of public health officials, as we prioritize everyone's health and safety," Google said. Google has not shut down its Zurich office. However, it has restricted its employees from traveling to Iran and parts of Italy. In March that will expand to Japan and South Korea. The company had already prohibited travel to China, except for employees returning home. Companies are becoming increasingly concerned as the outbreak is spreading rapidly with more than 50 countries now reporting cases. The World Health Organization said on Friday that the risk of global impact from the virus is "very high." In an effort to reduce their workers' potential exposure, many firms are limiting travel and pulling out of events and conferences that bring large numbers of people together. A spokesperson for Amazon confirmed that the company has also placed a restriction for all non-essential travel. Amazon had previously asked workers to restrict all travel to China. JPMorgan is also curbing non-essential employee travel, according to Bloomberg News. On Friday, Google canceled its two-day Global News Initiative summit scheduled to take place in northern California in April. The day before, Facebook called off its biggest event of the year, its F8 developers conference set for May. Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Sony and Activision have all canceled plans to attend next month's Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.  A major smartphone industry trade show, Mobile World Congress, was called off earlier this month after a slew of participants pulled out. NPR's Alina Selyukh contributed to this report.

 Traders work during the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. Losses on Wall Street deepened following a bruising open, as global markets were poised to conclude their worst week since 2008 with another rout. Updated at 5:40 p.m. ET Stocks took another steep dive Friday, deepening a multi-day rout fueled by fears about the coronavirus' impact on the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 357 points on Friday, capping a week in which the blue chip index fell 3,583 points or 12.4%. The Dow is down 16.3% from its recent peak on Feb. 12. The S&P 500 stock index lost 11.5% for the week and is now down 14.6% from the all-time high it reached only last week. The Nasdaq inched into positive territory in the closing minutes of trading Friday, but is still down 10.5% for the week and 14.6% below its record high last Wednesday. The drop in stocks this week has come with stunning speed, as investors grapple with evidence that the deadly coronavirus epidemic is spreading beyond China to other countries, including Italy, South Korea and Iran. "It's unprecedented, really. And certainly in my career, and even if you go back 70 years, we've never had a correction--that is a 10% pullback from a high--develop so quickly," said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell sought to calm jittery investors, with reassurance that the central bank is prepared to cut rates if necessary.

 A pedestrian walks past a board displaying the closing figure of the Nikkei Stock Average in Tokyo on Friday. All of the major indexes are now in what the markets call a correction, and stocks also were down in Asia and Europe. "The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong," Powell said in a rare, written statement. "However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook. We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy." The Trump Administration argued that the plummet in stock prices was unlikely to affect the broader economy. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, called the downturn a "short-term market plunge" and said, "I don't think at this point it's going to have much of an impact." Kudlow said he had spoken to corporate CEOs and had not heard of serious supply-chain problems. But investors appear anxious anyway, and the interest rate on U.S. government debt, which usually falls in turbulent times, lost more ground. The 10-year Treasury bill dipped to a record low of 1.15%. "Uncertainty regarding something as serious as this has a tendency to induce the kind of fear that in in the market's view is 'sell [first] and ask questions later,'" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. With the S&P 500 index down 14.6%, the market is officially in what Wall Street calls a market correction when stocks are at least 10% below a recent high. All three major stock indexes posted their largest ever point drops on Thursday. Companies around the world are cutting production and canceling conferences to limit the outbreak's spread. JPMorgan Chase announced it is eliminating nonessential employee travel, while United Airlines said today it is reducing flights to Japan, Singapore and South Korea. As businesses slow down, economists say the odds of a global recession have increased significantly. "With the coronavirus pandemic spreading throughout the world, falling corporate sales and its economic impact will depress economic growth," wrote Sung Won Sohn, professor of economics at Loyola Marymount University.

 An airplane arrives at London's Heathrow Airport on Thursday — the same day a court blocked plans for a third runway at the airport, citing the government's climate change commitments. The U.K. Court of Appeal dealt has dealt climate activists a big legal win, blocking plans for the addition of a third runway at London's Heathrow Airport, one of the busiest international hubs in the world. In its judgment Thursday, the three-justice panel concluded that the plans failed to satisfy the government's stated commitments on combating climate change. "The Paris Agreement ought to have been taken into account by the Secretary of State," Lord Justice Lindblom wrote Thursday, referring to the landmark climate deal in which nearly 200 countries vowed in 2015 to reduce their greenhouse emissions. Last year, the U.K. also became the first of the major Group of Seven countries to enact a pledge aiming to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 — a pledge that the office of Chris Grayling, then the secretary of state for transport, failed to keep in mind when crafting the plans in its Airports National Policy Statement. "That, in our view, is legally fatal to the ANPS in its present form," Lindblom said. The decision represents yet another blow to an expansion campaign that has seen its fair share of setbacks. A similar plan for a third runway at Heathrow, laid out by the airport's operator — Heathrow Airport Holdings Limited, formerly BAA — fell apart about a decade ago amid significant resistance from local residents.  The U.K. government revived the moribund campaign with a commission recommendation in 2015, on which Grayling's office followed up a few years later with its statement laying out how the airport ought to go about the expansion. But critics remained just as opposed. And they gathered a wide-ranging coalition of skeptics — including a pair of politicians who are usually at odds, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and his predecessor, Boris Johnson. Johnson, now prime minister, famously once promised to lie down in front of bulldozers to prevent the construction of the third runway. Ultimately, the legal challenge decided Thursday succeeded on environmental grounds. Plan B, the climate-focused legal charity that brought the claim, cheered the decision as a landmark that "will be hugely influential across the UK and around the world." "The message is finally getting through," the group said in a statement released Thursday. "The bell is tolling on the carbon economy loud and clear." Greta Thunberg, the teen climate activist named Time magazine's Person of the Year in 2019, also celebrated the decision: "Imagine when we all start taking the Paris Agreement into account," she tweeted Thursday. Grayling's successor as secretary of state for transport, Grant Shapps, announced that the U.K. government has no plans to appeal the decision — perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Johnson now leads the national government. "Airport expansion is core to boosting global connectivity," Shapps tweeted, noting that any Heathrow expansion must be "industry led," not pushed by the government. "We also take seriously our commitment to the environment." Still, the plan isn't exactly dead — a point that Justice Lindblom himself made clear in the judgment. He said the decision rests on a failure to consider the country's climate commitments, not a fundamental incompatibility with those commitments. "We have not decided, and could not decide, that there will be no third runway at Heathrow," he wrote. "We have not found that a national policy statement supporting this project is necessarily incompatible with the United Kingdom's commitment to reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change under the Paris Agreement, or with any other policy the Government may adoptor international obligation it may undertake." And Heathrow Airport Holdings has no intention of backing down, saying in a statement Thursday that the court's concern "is eminently fixable." "We will appeal to the Supreme Court on this one issue and are confident that we will be successful," the airport operator said, noting that it, too, is committed to Britain's net-zero emissions pledge. "Expanding Heathrow, Britain's biggest port and only hub, is essential to achieving the Prime Minister's vision of a Global Britain. We will get it done the right way, without jeopardising the planet's future."
How Wealth Has Changed,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/27/810006404/how-wealth-has-changed,February 27, 2020, Think about how the global economy has evolved in the last couple of hundred years. The size of a country's territory matters less, and the skillset of its citizens matters more. And now, nearly two-thirds of all the wealth in the world is human capital — ideas, process knowledge, learning.  This evolution has implications for geopolitics — or at least it should, if only politicians understood it better. Charles Kenny joins Cardiff Garcia to discuss.  Music by Drop Electric.

Dow Falls Nearly 1,200 Points; Stocks Now In Correction Territory,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/27/809934194/stocks-slide-into-correction-territory-on-coronavirus-fears,February 27, 2020,

 Traders work during the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. Wall Street stocks opened sharply lower amid fears the coronavirus will grow into a significant international health crisis. Updated at 4:05 p.m. ET Stocks continued their free-fall on Thursday, with major indexes falling into correction territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled nearly 1,200 points as worries mounted about the economic toll of a widening coronavirus epidemic. The Dow ended the day down 4.4%, and nearly 13% below its recent peak on Feb. 12. A drop of 10% from a recent high is the technical definition of a "correction." The broader S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq are also in correction territory. Both are down more than 12% from their recent peak, reached just last Wednesday. President Trump tried to project a note of calm in a news conference Wednesday evening, stressing that the United States is well prepared for any health crisis and predicting the stock market will recover, thanks in part to robust consumer spending. But investors were not immediately reassured. A poll by Morning Consult this week found that 69% of U.S. adults are either "very" or "somewhat" concerned about the domestic economic impact of the epidemic, a 14 point increase from a few weeks ago. Goldman Sachs lowered its forecast of corporate profits for this year and next. The firm expects zero growth in profits in 2020, as a result of reduced economic activity in both China and the U.S., reduced demand for American exports, supply chain disruptions and increased uncertainty. The steep drop in financial markets could put a dent in consumer confidence and spending — a major driver of the U.S. economy. It may also increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. On Tuesday, the central bank's vice chairman, Richard Clarida, said the Fed is monitoring the outbreak closely but he cautioned it's too soon to assess the economic effects. Health officials also reported the first known case of coronavirus in the U.S. with no apparent link to China or other sources, suggesting that the virus may be spreading domestically.

 A protester holds a sign reading "The Oceans Are Rising But So Are We" at an Amazon employee walkout in Seattle, as part of the Global Climate Strike on Sept. 20, 2019. At some companies, employees are putting increasing pressure on their bosses to act on climate change. Jet fuel-guzzling Delta Air Lines and fossil fuel-pumping BP are vowing to go carbon neutral. Microsoft and Ikea, behemoths of tech and furniture, have pledged  to go further and actively reduce the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The financial giant Blackrock promises to put climate at the heart of its decisions.  In short, a slew of major corporations are making promises on climate — lofty ones.  And it's not just a case of a few headline-grabbing outliers. More companies are disclosing their carbon emissions, and more of those companies have emissions reductions targets, according to the global nonprofit CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project).   Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Those targets are also more ambitious. Engie Impact, a sustainability company tied to a French energy group, analyzed CDP data and found "the intensity of the commitments is rising," as Engie Impact's Mathias  Lelièvre puts it.    Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here.  Companies are promising faster action, too. Instead of setting goals 25 years in the future — a distant target that makes accountability difficult — the average time horizon is now just eight years away, Engie Impact found. And there's been an acceleration in the rate at which companies set "science-based targets" — specific, measurable carbon reduction goals that put a company in line with the Paris Agreement, the global climate accord aiming to hold warming at 2 degrees Celsius or lower. Coca-Cola, Nike, Best Buy, Walmart and Hilton Hotels are among the hundreds of companies with such targets. According to one analysis, the number of Fortune 500 companies with concrete, ambitious carbon targets quadrupled in the past four years, to 23%.   Growing pressure to act This increase in activity comes after decades of pressure from environmental advocates — and despite a lack of action from the U.S. government.  So after all this time, what might be spurring companies to set new or newly ambitious targets?  For one thing, the effects of climate change are becoming clearer to companies as wildfires, rising sea levels, droughts and other symptoms of the crisis make headlines and affect business operations. "It's here," says Bruno Sarda, the president of CDP North America. "It's happening now, not tomorrow."  At the same time, solar and wind energy have gotten significantly cheaper, making it easier for some companies to commit to shifting away from fossil fuels. And an increase in pressure — on multiple fronts — plays a key role.  "Investors are increasingly asking companies about this," says Kevin Moss, who runs the center for business sustainability at the World Resources Institute. "And not just the traditional activist investors who have been doing it for some time, but mainstream investors."  Pressure from customers and the general public is mounting, too, as public awareness and concern grows more intense. And while the federal government in the U.S. has backed away from climate targets, cities and states — not to mention governments abroad — are taking action. There might be some more surprising sources of pressure, too. Children.  "I hear from business leaders all the time today that, you know, their kids come home and say, 'What are you doing, Dad?' " says Elizabeth Sturcken, a managing director at the Environmental Defense Fund who works with businesses on sustainability goals. "This makes a difference."  Employees, too, are increasingly influential. Workers at companies such as Amazon are pushing their bosses to change, and some other companies see this as a way to attract and retain talent. Kyum Kim is the co-founder of the app Blind, where tech workers discuss their workplaces, and he says those workers are increasingly discussing issues like climate change. In a survey, half his users said a company's climate policy affects whether they want to work there.  "People talk a lot about compensation, of course, and the work culture," he says, "but I think this is a whole new segment."  There's another factor, too, according to Lucas Joppa, the chief sustainability officer at Microsoft.  He says it helps to frame climate action as an accounting problem, based on quantifying exactly how much companies emit and how much they'll need to cut.  "That really is what I see flip executives' mindsets around, is to just talk about this in terms that they understand ... a climate 'budget,' " Joppa says. "At the end of the day, what companies are really good at doing is making decisions based on numbers." The limits of voluntary targets Of course, setting a carbon budget is one thing. Sticking to it is another. Some climate announcements in the past — such as BP's previous rebranding as "Beyond Petroleum" — have been more PR push than actual shift in strategy, and advocates agree that follow-through and accountability will be essential if these new ambitious targets are to have an impact.  And even if companies make good on their promises, some experts say there can be a danger in relying on big corporations to drive the fight against climate change. Shalanda Baker, a professor at Northeastern University who studies the social justice dimensions of a transition away from fossil fuels, says vulnerable and marginalized communities need to have input in how the world fights climate change — and feel the benefits of a switch to green energy.  "I'm just not sure if I have the faith, given that ... corporations are very concerned about expenses and profits, that they would really think about something that may add cost, but that may be more just," she says. Baker says corporate action can be powerful but government policy can make sure vulnerable populations are protected.  She's not the only one who looks at these voluntary commitments and sees a need for regulation. After all, some companies taking action is nowhere near enough to stop climate change.  Elizabeth Sturcken at the EDF, who has spent two decades urging companies to act, tells companies that in addition to voluntary cuts in emissions, it's critical for business leaders to engage with policymakers and ask for government action.  Corporations from BP to PepsiCo say they support a price on carbon, one market-based policy for reducing emissions. Sturcken says companies that really want to lead on climate need to put money toward making such policies a reality.

But this year the "Super Bowl of stock car racing" comes at a precarious time for the sport's governing body, NASCAR.   Once a cultural force and behemoth in the world of professional sports, NASCAR has in recent years seen its TV ratings and attendance numbers plummet, leading some to wonder if one of America's most popular spectator sports might be stalling out.  Now NASCAR faces a dilemma that many businesses face: what to do when your winning formula is no longer so winning.

 The new coronavirus has yet to sicken American health workers, as it has in China. But deaths of hospital workers in Asia have heightened scrutiny of the U.S. health care system's ability to protect people on the front line. Updated at 6:52 p.m. ET The U.S. health care system is trying to be ready for possible outbreaks of the new coronavirus, after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned communities this week to prepare for the kind of spread now being seen in Iran, Italy, South Korea and other areas outside the virus' epicenter in China. The CDC notes there are only 15 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States, plus 45 more cases among Americans who were brought home from the Diamond Princess cruise ship or via flights from Asia arranged by the U.S. State Department. The vast majority of those total cases in the U.S. are travel related; there are no signs, so far, that the virus has spread beyond the CDC totals. Still, some U.S. health care workers on the front line, including Maureen Dugan, worry they are not properly prepared. Dugan is a veteran nurse at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, where two coronavirus patients were transferred this month. UCSF is one of the premier hospitals in the country, but Dugan says her frustrations are mounting because she says her employer offered little notice or training to those caring for the infected patients. "We want to do the best. We work extremely hard to do the best for our patients, so don't set us up to fail," Dugan says. "It's not only nurses — it's all the other staff. It's nursing assistants; it's transport. Every staff member is worried." Coronavirus has yet to sicken American health workers, as it has in China. But deaths of hospital workers in Asia have heightened scrutiny of the U.S. health care system's ability to protect people on the front line. Dugan says the medical community wasn't fully prepared for previous viruses, like SARS and Ebola — and she's concerned that lessons learned are not being applied today. For example: The protective garments provided, she says, leave the wearer's neck exposed. The Coronavirus OutbreakWhat you should know  Subscribe to Goats and Soda's newsletter for a weekly update on the outbreak.   "The gowns that they're providing are inadequate," she says, with emotion. "I'm sorry — I get very passionate about this, because we've worked so hard to make sure that our nurses were protected and therefore they can protect the public." UCSF said in a written response to NPR that it has taken multiple "extensive" safety precautions, including isolating sick patients in rooms with special ventilation systems and training staff with proper use of safety gear. In regards to the two coronavirus cases Dugan refers to, UCSF said it briefed the workers who were actually treating the patients. But the hospital does not — as a matter of course — inform general staff of incoming infection cases. World health officials warn that COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, may enter a new phase in the U.S. at some point. Thus far, U.S. hospitals have been able to plan for transfers of incoming patients whose condition is already known. That's very different from a spreading outbreak, where sick people walk in off the street — a far more difficult scenario for health care workers and the public they treat. "It's the unrecognized case that comes through your hospital system or your clinics that really pose the greatest risk," says Mark Rupp, chief of infectious disease at the University of Nebraska. Rupp's hospital is considered a model for managing infections. Its pioneering medical center is one of the few with experience treating Ebola. It has an isolation chamber that filters pathogens, and it practices dry runs, making sure respiration masks fit workers. Most critically, he says, hospital staff verbally screen patients at the facility's entrance, asking about symptoms and travel history. Without that sort of logistical control at a hospital's entrance, he says, a coughing patient can quickly infect medical staff and other patients waiting in the emergency room or a clinic. But what about the thousands of other hospitals without extensive experience with the riskiest cases? How are they bracing for a potential outbreak? Those medical centers are also preparing, says Nancy Foster, vice president of quality and patient safety for the American Hospital Association. "Everyone I've spoken to says they've taken substantial steps to make sure they are prepared," including steps like isolating infectious patients and conserving face masks to ensure supplies last, Foster says. But not all staff working at those hospitals feel ready. National Nurses United is conducting an ongoing survey that as of last week found that about 31% of nearly 5,000 nurse respondents said they didn't have enough protective gear to handle a surge of coronavirus cases. Only 9% said their hospital or clinic had plans to isolate potentially infected patients. "That's not high enough for us to feel comfortable," says Bonnie Castillo, president of the nurses union. She notes that many hospitals are already operating at capacity and that if the coronavirus spreads in the U.S., it will stress the system even more. "If health care workers and nurses aren't protected, no one is protected," Castillo says. Meanwhile, the White House has requested $1.25 billion in new funding to support preparedness and vaccine development. Congressional Democrats — as well as some Republicans — are calling that amount insufficient.

 Demonstrators rally for better wages outside a McDonald's restaurant in Chicago in December 2013. Kim Thomas felt drawn to being a home health aide after caring for her own ailing mother. Human dignity, she says, can be simple, like a bath and a favorite snack. When Thomas first started visiting homes to care for patients, she made $7 an hour. That was in North Carolina about 16 years ago. Her pay inched up over time, to $10.50. To try to make ends meet, she sometimes would work through the night, dozing in patients' homes.  That's when Thomas, 55, discovered and joined the Fight for $15 movement, which had galvanized workers around the U.S. to march and rally for higher pay. Initially, in 2012, it started with mainly fast-food and retail workers. But within years, the campaign drew in low-wage workers from all over, including those with jobs in airports, child and health care, even universities. It grew into one of the largest waves of labor activism in recent history. And it was unusual. Though rallies were funded and organized by labor unions — including the prominent Service Employees International Union — the tens of thousands of workers who showed up did not belong to a union, nor could they join one. 
                "Walking off the job, you're taking on your boss head-on, and that sounds like some pretty scary stuff, right?" says fast-food worker Terrence Wise, shown here at a 2013 strike in Kansas City, Mo. "But I always thought, what am I more afraid of? Taking on my boss or being homeless again with my three little girls?"

 "Walking off the job, you're taking on your boss head-on, and that sounds like some pretty scary stuff, right?" says fast-food worker Terrence Wise, shown here at a 2013 strike in Kansas City, Mo. "But I always thought, what am I more afraid of? Taking on my boss or being homeless again with my three little girls?" The demonstrations grabbed headlines as they gained momentum across the country. Sit-ins, arrests for civil disobedience and call-outs like "Hold the burgers, hold the fries, make our wages supersized" made the evening news. Their chants and posters started melding with other movements like Black Lives Matter and #MeToo. High-profile politicians like Bernie Sanders began joining the rallies. The campaign started to see results as over half of U.S. states and more cities went on to raise minimum wages, a few of them to $15. This, in turn, helped propel an extraordinary change in the U.S. economy: A few years later, wages started growing faster at the bottom than the top. The National Employment Law Project, which advocates for low-wage workers, estimates that new state and local wage laws gave some 22 million workers a collective raise of $68 billion. "I was just talking to a friend recently, like, 'bro, we would still probably be making 7, 8 bucks an hour if we never stood up and fought,' " says Terrence Wise, 40, who's now with McDonald's. He has testified before Congress and spoken at the White House as one of the faces of the movement. Wise was working two jobs — at Burger King and Pizza Hut — in Kansas City, Mo., when the Fight for $15 arrived there. It was one the first few cities where low-wage workers rallied within months of the original 2012 strike of New York's fast-food cooks and cashiers. Within years, demonstrations ballooned to over 200 cities.

 Police surround striking McDonald's workers sitting in an intersection in Los Angeles, demanding a $15 per hour wage and union rights during nationwide 'Fight for $15 Day of Disruption' in November 2016. The timing proved instrumental. The economy was recovering from the Great Recession and unemployment was falling, which meant that employers were finding it more difficult to draw workers. And even though corporate executives were getting bonuses, low-wage workers had not seen raises in years. The federal minimum had been stuck since 2009 at $7.25 an hour, where it remains today. Businesses have long argued that higher wages risk hurting workers overall because their cost forces employers to weight cutbacks on hours or even staff. Eventually, some of the nation's largest employers including Target, Walmart and Amazon made splashy announcements about lifting their lowest wages. Amazon and Walmart even began advocating for a higher federal minimum. Economists including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have acknowledged that higher minimum-wage laws on the state and local level played a role: Pay grew faster in places that raised their minimums, Powell said in Congress this month. "But really it's much broader than that," he added. "A bigger factor really just is very low unemployment and a strong labor market, high job creation, that's the main driver."  Loading...  Nonetheless, workers in the Fight for $15 attribute their pay increases to their movement. Rosa Calderon, 49, is one such worker who thanks the labor organizing for recent pay bumps she and her son both got at McDonald's in Santa Clarita, Calif. "Before, I used to have to share an apartment with another family," Calderon told NPR in Spanish, "but now I have my own apartment for my own family." But the marches haven't stopped. That's because for all the states that did raise their pay minimums, many didn't. Neither did Congress. The campaign did not spur a surge of unionizing. The value of $15 is worth less and less every year. Workers say they still join the campaign to push for the right to unionize, to get collective bargaining for better pay and benefits. 
                Service workers march at Newark Liberty International Airport in November 2016, asking for $15 minimum wage.

 "I don't want to live payday to payday — that's not a life to live," says Ronald Franklin, 49, a former U.S. Navy veteran who's now a warehouse and ramp agent for a contractor at Chicago's O'Hare Airport. He says he commutes for about three hours to work and makes $14.10 an hour. Health aide Thomas says she lives "a promise-to-pay to promise-to-pay" life, by covering what she can when bill collectors call about her cellphone or car insurance payments. 
                Home health aide Kim Thomas says she hopes "North Carolina, South Carolina and some of the southern states ... will see that paying people a minimum wage or paying a livable wage is two separate things."

 Thomas now cares for the sick and dying as a hospice aide in South Carolina, starting her days around 4:30 a.m., visiting up to a dozen people a day. For many, she's the first person they see, helping them get up, shower, dress and eat. "I truly feel like this is where god wants me to be," Thomas says, and later adds: "When I started hearing how many states are actually winning the $15 an hour, it gives me hope." She says she now makes $13 an hour — still fighting for the elusive $15. NPR's Nicole Cohen contributed to this report.

 Planet Money tries to make vodka in a radio studio. Note: This episode first ran on February 23, 2018. A bottle of fancy vodka, like Grey Goose, costs about $35. A bottle of the cheap stuff can be less than $10. That's a wide range, but, by definition, vodka is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. So, could there really be a difference between vodkas? Or is the difference all in the marketing?  Today on the show, we get to the bottom of the question. We go to a distillery and find out how vodka is actually made, we hear the story of the genius who created the whole concept of super premium vodka, and we find out where a lot of vodka really comes from. Finally, we see if we can make our own.  This episode features Dan Pashman, host of The Sporkful.  Music: "Sideswipe" and "Take the Lead."

 A ConocoPhillips drilling site on Alaska's North Slope in 2016. JPMorgan Chase is the latest in a growing list of investors to restrict work with coal companies and stop funding new oil and gas projects in the Arctic.  Its announcement this week was met with disappointment from environmental advocates, who want more aggressive action from one of the fossil fuel industry's biggest lenders. But the news has hit harder in Alaska, where most oil is produced from the Arctic's North Slope, and the government depends on the industry for revenue. The string of announcements has left elected officials and oil companies playing defense. In December, Goldman Sachs said the bank would refuse to finance Arctic drilling, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  Since then Barclays and Lloyds Bank of Great Britain have also effectively ruled out investments in new projects there, after environmentalists raised concerns about impacts on ecosystems, indigenous people and the global climate. "One position by one large company I don't think changes a lot," says Andy Mack, a former Alaska natural resources commissioner who helped lead the state's push to open the Arctic Refuge to drilling. "But if you see two or three or four large companies make these types of announcements, it's certainly something that oil companies will all have to take into account." Many other investors remain for Arctic projects, and the Trump administration has pushed to open the Arctic Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska to new development. But an aggressive environmental advocacy campaign has created undeniable obstacles for businessmen like Mead Treadwell, who's seeking investment for his company Qilak LNG.  Qilak is pushing a liquefied natural gas project on the North Slope, and Treadwell has honed his pitch accordingly, to respond to the questions and concerns he expects from bankers. He plays up the fact that Qilak's LNG project would connect to infrastructure that already largely exists on the North Slope — not to new oil fields, which conservation groups say would extend the world's dependence on climate-warming fossil fuels. Treadwell also makes the case that LNG often displaces dirty coal-fired power plants, though the environmental benefits of that change are disputed by some scientists. And he highlights the jobs the project could create for indigenous residents of the North Slope and other areas of Alaska. It's easier to show up at an annual meeting in some place like London or Brussels wearing a polar bear suit. There's not a similar symbol for Louisiana or Texas. Mead Treadwell, Qilak LNG "I still believe that we will have billions of dollars in annual investment in the Arctic," Treadwell says. But "it's easier to show up at an annual meeting in some place like London or Brussels wearing a polar bear suit. There's not a similar symbol for Louisiana or Texas." Alaska's economy is driven by the production of fossil fuels, which makes the state especially vulnerable to the campaign to transition away from oil. About a third of the state's unrestricted revenue comes from taxes and royalties tied to oil production. The environmental movement has been targeting Arctic oil and gas projects in particular, arguing that development in the area poses unique environmental and social risks. Democratic members of Congress also got involved after Goldman Sachs' announcement, writing to other banks to ask them to follow the company's lead. Several big Arctic oil projects are still under development on Alaska's North Slope. But there's a growing acknowledgment that the environmental lobbying is having an effect. "'Arctic' seems to have turned into a four-letter word in the minds of a lot of these financial institutions," says an Alaska oil executive, who asked not to be named to avoid drawing attention to his particular company. Hitting back by punishing banks Gov. Mike Dunleavy reacted to Goldman Sachs' announcement by firing the company from a group of Wall Street firms it had chosen to help the state borrow money.  In an interview, Dunleavy suggested another way to punish banks that refuse to invest in Alaska oil projects: cutting them off from managing the assets of the $67 billion state-owned Permanent Fund, which was originally created with oil revenue. Goldman Sachs manages some $400 million for the fund, which paid the firm a total of $17 million in fees over the past three years. "Some of these groups that don't want to do business in Alaska still want Alaska business," Dunleavy says. "They probably are going to come out a loser on that one." In Washington, D.C., the members of Alaska's GOP Congressional delegation have sent their own letters to banking executives. "I can tell you for a fact I have never signed on to a letter that would specifically target investment opportunities in another colleague's state, to shut that down," U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said in an interview. She and other Alaska politicians note that there's support for continuing Arctic oil production among the North Slope's indigenous Inupiat people, who have benefited financially from development.  The North Slope Borough's mayor, Harry Brower, writing in the Wall Street Journal, called Goldman Sachs' new investment policy "subtly racist," and argued that it would effectively deny modern amenities to the region's isolated villages. Another indigenous group, the Gwich'in, has fought oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, citing risks to the caribou that they subsist on. Brad Keithley, a retired oil and gas attorney, says there's a new argument that Alaska leaders could use to make their case to financial institutions. The state's oil industry uses comparatively little energy to produce its fossil fuels, according to newly-presented analysis from the Climate Leadership Council, an international group pushing a carbon fee and dividend program as a way to reduce emissions.  In an email, council spokesman Carlton Carroll says that's in part because of Alaska's restrictions on flaring natural gas, and the industry's "consolidated and efficient infrastructure" in the state. Those working to push financial institutions out of the oil industry, meanwhile, argue that Alaska's political leaders should be doing more to prepare the state for an economic future that's less dependent on fossil fuels. "There's an opportunity to plan ahead," says Ruth Breech of the Rainforest Action Network. "That's why the leadership is important now."

 Janet Jenkins used RedfinNow, an iBuyer service, to quickly sell her home near Los Angeles. The company repainted it, spruced it up and put it back on the market for sale. If you're looking to sell your home and avoid people tromping through your living room at open houses, there's a new option that's becoming popular in many parts of the country. Companies called iBuyers, or instant buyers, use computer algorithms to make you an offer, often within a day. These types of sales are growing very quickly, according to new data out Wednesday. The way it works is that companies such as Redfin, Zillow, Opendoor and Offerpad will make you an almost instant offer over the Internet. They then send an inspector to take a closer look. Their sales pitch is they'll move very quickly and buy a house with very little hassle. "In Raleigh, more than 7% of sales in 2019 were iBuyer sales so it's becoming quite prevalent there," says Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist for Redfin, which is releasing a report on the iBuying industry.  Loading...  In Phoenix, Charlotte and Atlanta, iBuyers account for more than 5% of sales, according to Fairweather. She says in many of these same places iBuyer sales have doubled from the year before. Redfin's iBuyer service, RedfinNow, is also purchasing homes in Southern California. That's where Janet Jenkins was living until recently, when she and her husband separated. She moved across the country to North Carolina. And they decided to sell their home outside Los Angeles. 
                Janet Jenkins' rainbow lorikeet parrot named Malibu shows off his leg-lifting trick. Having parrot and dog cages in the house, not to mention the animals themselves, was one reason Jenkins decided open houses would be a hassle and selling to an iBuyer was a better option.

 Janet Jenkins' rainbow lorikeet parrot named Malibu shows off his leg-lifting trick. Having parrot and dog cages in the house, not to mention the animals themselves, was one reason Jenkins decided open houses would be a hassle and selling to an iBuyer was a better option. She wanted to get it done quickly. And listing through a broker and hosting open houses wasn't a great option for Jenkins. She has a lot of pets — parrots, peacocks and dogs. And her husband was still living in the house with some of them. One of her parrots, Wrangler, happily squawked away during her interview with NPR. She knew that real estate agents would want the animals and her estranged husband out of the house. "The parrot is not my husband's favorite pet," admits Jenkins. "And having to catch the bird and put it in a cage and take it someplace is a whole 'nother ask,' " she says with a laugh. The house also needed some repainting and new carpeting. She didn't want to deal with that. "And so I started looking up homebuying services and ran into Redfin," she says. The economist Fairweather says RedfinNow can get you the money for your home in as little as a week. She says a lot of people buying a new home and moving also appreciate that the iBuyers can be flexible and let them sell their house exactly when they want to. "So they can time it perfectly with their move," she says. After buying houses, the iBuyers fix them up a bit and then try to quickly sell them again for a profit. In Jenkins' case, she went online and answered some questions about her house. Redfin's computers ran their algorithms and the company made her an offer for about $500,000. Jenkins says she thought that was a little low. So did two of her close friends who are Realtors in the area. "So I pushed back," Jenkins says. It was a friendly negotiation. She made a case that her property had several advantages to others that had sold recently in her complex. A bigger backyard for one thing. Redfin then made her a better offer — and they had a deal. It's hard to know for sure, but Jenkins thinks she could have made a little bit more — maybe $10,000 — if she took the time to spruce the house up herself, repainted and made repairs, and sold it the traditional way. But she'd already moved across the country. "You do leave money on the table," Jenkins says. "And while we did, we didn't leave that much." Redfin does get a fee like a regular Realtor commission, but it didn't say what the average profit is on the houses it buys and then resells. So, is this a smart way to sell your house? We put that question to William Wheaton, a housing economist and professor at MIT. He says the iBuyer approach works in places where houses are similar. For example, the places where a lot of these iBuyer sales are growing quickly like Phoenix, Las Vegas and Atlanta. These markets have sprawling subdivisions with many houses that are almost identical. "There's not a lot of difficulty in pricing those houses," Wheaton says. "The ones with the swimming pool are worth a little more than the ones without. But you can do statistical modeling of that and just nail it, be 99% correct in predicting the price." And he says that means iBuyers can offer you just a little less than what the house is worth and still be confident they can sell it for a little profit. But it's a different story in areas where houses are not similar. Many older cities have some houses that are newer, some older, some renovated, some not, different styles, all mixed up in close proximity. Prices can be all over the place, and so in those areas, Wheaton says, "the iBuyers have to be really, really careful." He says being careful means they'd likely offer you a very lowball price because they aren't really sure what your house is worth and they don't want to lose money. That's why the iBuying companies so far are focusing on places with a lot of similar housing. In places like that, Wheaton thinks iBuyers could keep growing dramatically and really change the way homes are sold in large parts of the country.
Regulators Issue Another Safety Fix For Boeing's Troubled 737 Max Plane,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/25/809399855/regulators-issue-another-safety-fix-for-boeings-troubled-737-max-plane,February 25, 2020,

 A Boeing 737 Max 9 sits at the front of the assembly line at the company's airplane production facility in Renton, Wash., in February 2017. Federal aviation regulators issued a new round of safety fixes for Boeing's beleaguered 737 Max jetliners, mandating repairs to sections of the planes that could make them vulnerable to lightning strikes and other activity which might result in engine malfunction.  The proposed fix issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday said certain panels on the planes, including the metallic layer that serves as part of the shielding for aircraft wiring, is susceptible to potential "electromagnetic effects of lightning strikes or high intensity radiated fields."  Exposure to such events, the notice of posted to the federal register adds, "could potentially lead to a dual engine power loss event."  The latest FAA airworthiness directive comes less than three months after Boeing issued a service bulletin recommending action be taken on panels that enclose the 737 Max engine nacelles. Federal aviation officials estimate 128 of the 737 Max airplanes registered in the U.S. could be in need of the safety fixes. But the FAA said it is not certain Boeing's bulletin includes all the airplanes impacted by "the unsafe condition." Therefore, the FAA is expanding its mandate to include all Max aircraft in Boeing's fleet.  The aerospace manufacturer said in December that "the protective foil inside the composite panels may have gaps" on aircraft produced between February 2018 and June 2019.  A spokesperson for Boeing said the company is coordinating with customers to finish the work ahead of the Max jet's return to service.  It remains unclear when the Max will return to service.  The planes have been grounded worldwide since March following a pair of deadly crashes – a Lion Air flight off the coast of Indonesia in 2018 and an Ethiopian Airlines flight in 2019 – that killed a combined 346 people.  Boeing halted production of the Max aircraft, which had been its best-selling plane, in December amid a realization that federal officials would not grant a swift return to service.  The grounding and ceasing production have had ripple effects throughout Boeing's supply chain. This includes last month's announcement by Wichita-based Spirit AeroSystems that it was laying off 2,800 employees due to uncertainty over when Boeing would resume production of the plane.  Boeing said in a January statement that the company estimates FAA and global regulators would proceed with the "ungrounding" of the 737 Max sometime in mid-2020.

 Specialist Meric Greenbaum works at his post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Feb. 25, 2020. Stocks fell sharply for a second day in a row. The Dow dropped 879 points on Tuesday, after tumbling more than 1,000 points on Monday.  While the coronavirus outbreak in China appears to have peaked, investors are worried by the growing number of cases in other countries, as well as a warning from U.S. health officials that the virus could hit closer to home.  Just last week, the S&P 500 stock index was hitting record highs. Now it's fallen more than 6% in just the last two days. Financial analyst Greg McBride of Bank Rate says mini outbreaks of coronavirus in Italy, Iran, and South Korea have left investors wondering where the virus will strike next. "Markets hate uncertainty," McBride said. "And right now there is a ton of uncertainty about the coronavirus and what impact does this have on economic growth, both globally as well as here in the U.S."  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention seemed to amplify those worries Tuesday when officials warned that Americans should prepare for a possible spread of the coronavirus in the U.S.  As investors dumped stocks, some sought the shelter of government bonds. McBride says that pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to an all-time low: barely above 1.3%.  "Those low interest rates are a reflection of the fear that a lot of investors have globally about slower economic growth," McBride said. President Trump often points to a booming stock market as a barometer of his own performance. With the market tanking for the second day in a row, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow tried to do some damage control.  Kudlow told CNBC that while the coronavirus has exacted a heavy human toll, especially in China, there's little evidence so far that it's hurting the US economy. "The head of the World Health Organization said today, let us not overreact," Kudlow said. "On the economy ... there is no tragedy in the United States."  Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida told a gathering of economists this afternoon the central bank is monitoring the epidemic closely.  He said it's too soon to speculate about the effects on the global economy.   There is some upside to the this week's market turbulence.  McBride says the record low yield on government bonds will likely push mortgage rates even lower, giving a lift to the U.S. housing market.  "If you're a homebuyer, if you can find a house to buy, from a mortgage standpoint you've got a little bit more buying power at your back," he said.  McBride says long-term investors might also find some bargains in the beaten-down stock market.  But, he cautions, the wild market swings are likely to be with us for a while. 
Why Netflix Turned To Junk,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/25/809386076/why-netflix-turned-to-junk,February 25, 2020, When Netflix started up its streaming service, its strategy looked brilliant: license movies and TV shows from the companies that made them, deliver the content over the Internet to users like you and me, and collect a little fee for operating as the middle man.   It didn't take the content providers — studios like Disney, for example — long to figure out that they could do exactly what Netflix did. And they began starting up their own operations. And pulling their content from Netflix servers. Netflix was in a pickle. But rather than close up its tent, it decided to make the same pivot the studio did, only in reverse. It decided to become a content creator. And so became some of the world's favorite shows: Stranger Things; The Crown; F is For Family; The Witcher ... OK, maybe not that last one.  Netflix did the impossible. But it couldn' do it alone. It takes huge amounts of money to create video content, and  while Netflix had a great subscriber base, those subscriptions alone didn't bring in a fraction of the cash it needed. So it turned to the dark side. The junk bond market. Music by Drop Electric. Find us: Twitter / Facebook / Newsletter.  Subscribe to our show on Apple Podcasts, PocketCasts and NPR One.

 The front of a Tesla Model X in Los Angeles in 2017. Irresponsibility — by carmaker Tesla and by a Tesla driver — contributed to a deadly crash in California in 2018, federal investigators say.  The driver appears to have been playing a game on a smartphone immediately before his semi-autonomous 2017 Model X accelerated into a concrete barrier. Distracted by his phone, he did not intervene to steer his car back toward safety and was killed in the fiery wreck.  But Tesla should have anticipated that drivers would misuse its "autopilot" feature like this and should build in more safeguards to prevent deadly crashes.  That's according to the National Transportation Safety Board, which spent nearly two years investigating the crash.  Tesla's advanced driver assistance software is called "Autopilot." That suggests the car can steer autonomously, but the system is limited and drivers are supposed to pay attention so they can take control from the car if necessary.  "When driving in the supposed self-driving mode, you can't sleep. You can't read a book. You can't watch a movie or TV show. You can't text. And you can't play video games," Robert L. Sumwalt, chairman of the NTSB, said Tuesday. But the NTSB did not solely blame the driver, Apple engineer Walter Huang, for the crash. It was also highly critical of Tesla for failing to anticipate and prevent this misuse of technology.  After all, there's video evidence that Tesla drivers using Autopilot do sleep, text, and, like Huang, play video games. Owners swap tips on forums about how to trick the software into thinking they're holding the steering wheel. In the case of Huang's crash, the vehicle's software had noticed that he did not have his hands on the wheel at the time of the crash. Still the SUV merely warned him to pay attention, rather than disabling the semi-autonomous steering.  Tesla also allows its Autopilot system to be used on roadways that the software is not designed to handle, creating safety risks, the NTSB says.  Other carmakers have similar issues with their advanced driver assistance features, the NTSB found. But only Tesla has failed to respond to the board's new recommendations.  The board also critiqued Apple, Huang's employer, for not prohibiting employees from using devices while driving. Huang was a game developer and was using his company-issued work phone at the time of the crash.  Highway maintenance also played a role in the severity of the crash, NTSB has previously said. A metal "crash cushion" should have softened the blow of the collision, but it had been damaged in a previous crash and was no longer effective.  The same barrier had been hit repeatedly over several years, including another crash that caused a fatality, and often went unrepaired for long stretches of time, according to NTSB documents.

 President Trump speaks Tuesday with business leaders in New Delhi. President Trump criticized remarks by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg as "inappropriate" and said the Supreme Court justices should recuse themselves from cases involving the president. "I just don't know how they cannot recuse themselves for anything Trump or Trump related," Trump said Tuesday in a wide-ranging news conference in New Delhi. "What Justice Sotomayor said yesterday was highly inappropriate," Trump added. "She's trying to shame people with perhaps a different view into voting her way."  The remarks are an apparent reference to a recent Sotomayor dissent in which she wrote that the administration had made a habit of turning to the Supreme Court after losses in lower courts. "Claiming one emergency after another, the government has recently sought stays in an unprecedented number of cases, demanding immediate attention and consuming limited court resources in each," Sotomayor wrote. "And with each successive application, of course, its cries of urgency ring increasingly hollow." She added that the Supreme Court was "partly to blame" because it "has been all too quick to grant the government's" requests.  Ginsburg had previously criticized Trump before he was elected president. Earlier, Trump tweeted: "Sotomayor accuses GOP appointed Justices of being biased in favor of Trump. ...  This is a terrible thing to say. Trying to 'shame' some into voting her way? She never criticized Justice Ginsberg when she called me a 'faker'. Both should recuse themselves."   “Sotomayor accuses GOP appointed Justices  of being biased in favor of Trump.” @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews  This is a terrible thing to say. Trying to “shame” some into voting her way? She never criticized Justice Ginsberg when she called me a “faker”. Both should recuse themselves.. The comments, made on the final day of his three-day visit to India, capped an otherwise positive trip for Trump: He was feted by the Indian government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, covered positively by the Indian media, and greeted by large crowds at a newly built cricket stadium in the western city of Ahmedabad.  The visit to India offered a welcome distraction to the president who, despite his acquittal earlier this month by the U.S. Senate following his impeachment by the House of Representatives, has continued to rail against congressional Democrats. Trump has previously criticized the judge in the trial of his ally Roger Stone, prompting pushback from his attorney general, William Barr; and last week, prior to his departure, news reports said that intelligence officials had told a House panel that Russia seemed to favor Trump in the 2020 election. Addressing that issue Tuesday, Trump accused Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee and who spearheaded the president's impeachment, of leaking details of the intelligence assessment.  Schiff has vigorously denied the allegation. The president also said he hadn't been briefed on the intelligence that suggested Russia was helping his campaign and that of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. "Nobody ever told me that," he said. He later added: "I want no help from any country, and I haven't been given any help from any country." The president tweeted repeatedly about many of those developments during his India trip. On Tuesday, he had the opportunity to address them in person. In a meeting with Indian business leaders Tuesday, Trump said he believed the U.S. economy would be hurt "if the wrong person gets elected" in November. "Everything will come to a halt," he said. Trump also addressed the U.S. stock market's plunge Monday, in which the Dow fell more than 1,000 points, or 3.56%, amid fears that the coronavirus would become a global pandemic. Trump tweeted Monday that the coronavirus "is very much under control in the USA" and that the "stock market starting to look very good to me." Earlier in the day Tuesday he said the stock market's plunge would "work out fine." Dow futures were up slightly after Trump's remarks Tuesday. On Monday, the White House sought an additional $2.5 billion from Congress to help in the fight against coronavirus. Trump leaves India later Tuesday following a state dinner in New Delhi.
Why America Is Losing The Toilet Race,https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/02/25/808791622/why-america-is-losing-the-toilet-race,February 25, 2020, Editor's note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here.  I just got back from my first trip to Japan, and I'm now in love with the country. The ramen, yakitori and sushi. The gorgeous volcanoes. The fascinating people and culture. But of all the things I fell in love with, there's one that I can't stop thinking about: the toilets.   Japanese toilets are marvels of technological innovation. They have integrated bidets, which squirt water to clean your private parts. They have dryers and heated seats. They use water efficiently, clean themselves and deodorize the air, so bathrooms actually smell good. They have white noise machines, so you can fill your stall with the sound of rain for relaxation and privacy. Some even have built-in night lights and music players. It's all customizable and controlled by electronic buttons on a panel next to your seat.  In Japan, these high-tech toilets are everywhere: hotels, restaurants, bus stations, rest stops and around 80% of homes. It's glorious. Then, I come back to the United States, and our toilets are stuck in the age of dirty coal mines and the horse and buggy. They basically have one feature: flush. No heated seats. No nice smells and sounds. No sanitizing blasts of liquid. It's like cleaning your dishes without water. It's gross. And it got me thinking: Why can't we have high-tech toilets too?  Most of the toilets in Japan are made by a company called Toto, which started the high-tech toilet revolution in 1980 when it unveiled the Washlet, a first-of-its-kind electric toilet seat with an integrated bidet. Toto has been innovating on the design ever since. So I reached out to the company. It put me in touch with Bill Strang, the president of corporate strategy and e-commerce at Toto USA.   
                The original Washlet

 "U.S. toilets are effectively bedpans with a drain," says Strang. Strang is originally from the Midwest, and he joined Toto 17 years ago. That's when he had his first experience with the Washlet bidet, and it was much like mine. It began with "apprehension, a little bit of angst," he says. But then he pushed the spray button and had a joyous sensation. The bathroom would never be the same.  The Washlet has been for sale in the U.S. since 1990, but it never took off. While Toto has found success with its traditional porcelain products (and manufactures them in the U.S. and Mexico), the Washlet remains a novelty, found mostly at some high-end hotels, showrooms and Japanese restaurants.   Economists spend a lot of time analyzing how and why technology spreads from one place to another. They call it "technology diffusion." One study looked at the spread of 20 technologies across 161 countries over the last 140 years, and it found evidence that geographic distance significantly slows the spread of new gadgets. It fits with the pattern we see with high-tech toilets. Strang says that after Japan, high-tech toilets have mostly spread to nations along the Pacific Rim.   But the speed of technology dispersion has sped up significantly in the modern era. Another study found that the spread of technologies developed after 1925 has been three times faster than the spread of those developed before 1925. That makes sense, with modern transportation and communication and all. But it has been many decades since the dawn of the new toilet era in Japan, and we are still mostly sitting on old-fashioned porcelain here. "Sometimes a technology never diffuses in a given country, even if it is superior to existing technologies," says Dartmouth College economist Diego Comin, who co-authored the study.   In the end, the biggest barrier to the toilet revolution is probably not distance but cultural mores. The Japanese, Strang says, highly prize bathing, hygiene and cleanliness. When I was in Tokyo and Sapporo, it was common to see Japanese people wearing masks to prevent the spread of germs. When you go out to dinner there, you're often given a hot, moist towel or wet wipe so your hands are clean before you eat. The streets and subways are spotless, and hand-sanitizing dispensers are everywhere. It felt much different from back home.    For the last five years, Strang says, Toto has been featuring its technological innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show, and they've made a splash. The company showcased products such as its glistening Neorest NX2 dual flush toilet. It's got the standard bidet, a dryer and a heated seat with temperature control. But it also has a "tornado flush system," a "bacteria-neutralizing ultraviolet light," a "titanium dioxide-fired toilet bowl," a remote control, a toilet seat that automatically opens and closes and an air deodorizer. It costs $17,300. Other Toto toilets and seats cost much less, but the lofty price of Japanese-style toilets are another reason that they might not be catching on.   Comin says he has considered buying a Japanese-style toilet, but, he adds, "they are so darn expensive." He believes getting Americans to embrace them would require "significant investments to educate the public about the new product, marketing (for example, a commercial with George Clooney using a Japanese toilet) and bringing down the price by mass producing."   But Strang remains optimistic about the future of toilets in America. "There hasn't been a demand for this type of product in the United States," Strang says. "But there wasn't a demand for Steve Jobs to make a product called the iPhone." Did you enjoy this newsletter? Well, it looks even better in your inbox! You can sign up here. 
'Facebook: The Inside Story' Reveals A Company Made In Its Founder's Image,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/25/807921978/facebook-the-inside-story-reveals-a-company-made-in-its-founder-s-image,February 25, 2020, The Inside Story by Steven Levy Hardcover, 583 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? In 2009, Mark Zuckerberg had a question for Facebook: "What do we want to be when we grow up?" While the social network was still several years away from going public, it was evolving beyond the startup phase. It had turned down a $1 billion offer to sell itself to Yahoo. It was competing for talented engineers with bigger Silicon Valley neighbors like Google. Facebook needed to define itself. Employees quickly zeroed in on where to find their answer: Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO. "He was Facebook culture," writes technology journalist Steven Levy in Facebook: The Inside Story, his exhaustive and well-paced history of the tech giant. "Companies are built in the image of their founders," one employee tells Levy. "For a while Facebook felt like a nineteen-year-old's dorm room, but ultimately it's a try-it-and-iterate place, which is how Mark exists as a human. He is a learn-by-doing person, and that is the DNA of the company." Or to put it another way, "move fast and break things" — which became Facebook's best-known slogan. From the viewpoint of 2020, the consequences of Facebook's unprecedented scale and growth — the spread of political disinformation and anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, live streamed suicides, posts fomenting violence against Myanmar's Rohingya minority — expose the shortcomings of that approach. Levy reassesses Facebook's past through today's criticisms: The company wields too much power without adequate trust or accountability. The indivisibility of the world's biggest social network from the Harvard dropout who created it is Levy's frame for understanding how Facebook got to where it is today. (It is also a management and financial reality for the company: Zuckerberg is CEO, chairman, and controls more than half of voting shares.) Levy's narrative is richly detailed, thanks to interviews with Facebookers past and present. He also got hold of pages from a 2006 notebook of Zuckerberg's, which serves as a sort of Rosetta Stone for some of the most significant decisions the CEO would make to expand Facebook from college campuses to the whole world. The company's origin story is well-known, recounted in books and on the silver screen. Levy's account of Zuckerberg's abbreviated Harvard tenure and Facebook's early years feel fresh, with plenty of color that reminds you the HBO show Silicon Valley did not have to reach far for its satire. The most substantial part of the book is its last third, when Levy dives into the 2016 election and its aftermath. Externally, Facebook faced escalating scrutiny of how its advertising engine and bias toward engaging — which often meant emotionally extreme — content were used by Russian operatives to fuel social division. Internally, Zuckerberg, his top deputy Sheryl Sandberg, and other executives failed to quickly grasp the scope of crises over and over again. Levy traces the most pressing problems — "the disregard for privacy, the data bartering with developers, the reckless international expansion" — to the means by which Facebook pursued Zuckerberg's ambition of connecting everyone. He writes: "The decisions [Zuckerberg] has made over the course of the past fifteen years have reflected a secondary set of goals — growth, competitive supremacy, and seeking massive profits. Because executing these sub-goals would help Facebook in its quest to connect the world, they became hopelessly intermingled with the mission itself, often leading Zuckerberg to make decisions that, in isolation, seem anything but idealistic." That includes several episodes where Facebook trampled on its users' privacy, such as when it let outside developers — including, infamously, Cambridge Analytica — suck up the information not just of people who chose to take the quizzes or play the games they created, but also of their unwitting friends. Levy, now a Wired editor-at-large, first met Zuckerberg in 2006. He recounts conversations with the CEO over the years, including a number of interviews Facebook sanctioned as part of substantial access it granted Levy for this book. Still, Facebook's founder remains a cipher in a book that in many ways doubles as his biography. Levy describes his interests (the Roman empire, the computer game Civilization) and his signature conversational tic: a silent, blank stare that one Facebook executive dubs "the eye of Sauron." At one point, Zuckerberg informs Levy, "I don't optimize for fun." But if Facebook is Mark Zuckerberg, what does Mark Zuckerberg stand for? Levy doesn't provide a clear answer. In their last interview in the summer of 2019, Zuckerberg acknowledges being "too idealistic and optimistic" to see how the global platform he created could be abused. But, as Levy writes, "the naïvety/idealism defense only goes so far." When pressed on whether Facebook abused its users' trust, Zuckerberg reframes the matter as a case of "try-it-and-iterate." "People think that we've eroded [privacy] or contributed to eroding it," he tells Levy. "I would actually argue that we have done privacy innovations." Just a few weeks later, Facebook announced a $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations.
For Richer Or... Richer,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/24/809050430/for-richer-or-richer,February 24, 2020, Assortative mating has been on the rise in the U.S. for decades. This is the trend in which people with the same backgrounds — the same incomes and education, for instance — increasingly marry each other.  The economist Branko Milanovic refers to it as "homogamy", and he says its causes — which include rising female labor force participation — are actually to be celebrated. But there is also evidence that assortative mating contributes to rising inequality, and to social separatism between high-income families and everyone else.  How should policymakers regard this trend? Should they do anything to address the resulting inequality?  On today's show, Milanovic shares thoughts on this trend from his latest book, Capitalism, Alone.  Music by Drop Electric. Find us: Twitter / Facebook / Newsletter.

 Specialist Mark Fitzgerald works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, Feb. 24, 2020. Markets are down across Europe, Asia, and the U.S. as the virus spreads to more countries around the world. Updated at 5:05 p.m. ET  The coronavirus contagion has spread to Wall Street. U.S. markets fell sharply Monday amid widening concern that the continuing spread of cases could lead to a global pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled nearly 1032 points, or 3.56% All of the major market indexes were down more than 3%. Stock markets in Europe and Asia were also down sharply. "This is not a health pandemic yet, but it's rapidly becoming an economic pandemic," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. Investors are spooked by the growing number of infections outside China, and the possible economic fallout if the epidemic cannot be contained. Growing clusters of coronavirus have been diagnosed in South Korea, Italy, and Iran.  South Korea in particular is a major economic player and a big supplier of components used by manufacturers around the world. The U.S. imported nearly $80 billion worth of goods from South Korea last year. Along with China and Japan, the country is a key supplier of computer and electronics products, fabricated metal products, and machinery.  "We import a fair amount of auto products from South Korea," said Jay Bryson, acting chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities. "If that country were to shut down for any reasonable length of time, then you could have supply chain repercussions here in the auto industry in the United States." In Italy, the number of reported infections ballooned from just three last week to more than 100, sparking fears of a wider spread in Europe.  "Think about Europe," Bryson cautioned. "Very open borders. And if people are infected in Italy, it could very well spread to other European countries." Italian authorities responded by canceling soccer matches, closing schools and ordering quarantines in a dozen northern towns.   President Trump offered reassurance after the market closed on Monday, tweeting "The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA."  Trump wrote that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization had been "working hard and very smart," before adding, "Stock Market starting to look very good to me!" Coronavirus was a main focus of discussion among G20 finance ministers, who held a previously scheduled meeting over the weekend in Saudi Arabia. In a communique, the finance ministers promised to monitor the outbreak, along with other risks to the global economy, and said they are prepared to take additional action as necessary.  Swonk warned the growing outbreak is, "feeding into the fears that people have out there, which is a tax on the global economy itself." She says if those fears trigger lasting changes in behavior, that will make a speedy economic recovery more difficult.
An Airbnb For Farmland Hits A Snag, As Farmers Raise Data Privacy Concerns,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2020/02/24/808764422/data-privacy-concerns-are-raised-after-startup-tries-to-rent-farmland,February 24, 2020,

 Soybean plants grow in a field near Tiskilwa, Ill. Parker Smith grows corn and soybeans on land near Champaign, Ill., together with his father and uncle. But Smith Farms doesn't own most of the land it uses. "About 75 percent of what we farm is rented ground," he says.  This is common. Across the Midwest, about half of all the farmland is owned by landlords who live somewhere else. Farmers compete to rent that land. "There's only so much ground, and most of the farmers out there want more, so obviously it gets pretty competitive," Smith says.  These farmer-landowner relationships can last for decades. They sometimes feel personal. So Smith was pretty upset when he heard that a company had sent letters to his landlords a few months ago, offering cash up front to rent the land that he's been farming.  The letters came from a company called Tillable, based in Chicago. It's backed by venture capital.  Corbett Kull, Tillable's CEO, says that his company sent out thousands of these letters to landowners. "A lot" of them took the offer, he says. His company will take that land and list it on its website as available to rent. It'll take bids from farmers and then sublet it.  American farmers spend about $32 billion each year to rent land, and Kull thinks Tillable could be farmland's AirBnB or Zillow. "This is one of the beauties of digital marketplaces, where you can bring two parties together that otherwise might never meet," he says.  Those letters to landowners, though, got a lot of farmers very angry. "They're reaching out to our landlords, that we have relationships with, to sort of go behind the farmer's back" and break up those relationships, Smith says.   Smith admits that this kind of thing does happen among farmers competing for land. But another factor played a big role in farmers' reaction. It's an unproven, very Internet-era suspicion about data and privacy.  Parker Smith, like a lot of farmers, uses equipment that automatically collects all kinds of data about his operations — like how much fertilizer he applies and how much grain he harvests from each small piece of each field. He pays a company called the Climate Corporation to manage that data and help him understand it.  Last fall, though, the Climate Corporation and Tillable announced a partnership. And after Smith learned about Tillable's letters to landowners, Smith had to wonder: Did Tillable target specific landlords because it got access to data about how productive and profitable their land is?  If someone had his data, Smith says, "they would know yields; they'd be able to roughly figure out how much money a guy was making."  Just over a week ago, Tillable, the company that's trying to use the Internet to disrupt farming, was itself disrupted by farmers on the Internet. Farmers on Twitter started sharing suspicions about the Tillable-Climate Corporation partnership. They accused the two companies of trafficking in farmer data.  Corbett Kull denies this. The accusations "were absolutely false," he says. "We had never accessed the data from Climate [Corporation]."  Yet the storm on social media forced the two companies to announce that they were cancelling their partnership.   Kull says this is not a major blow to Tillable's plans to expand. But the controversy could have one lasting effect. Parker Smith says that he never worried about his farm data before, and who might be able to to see it. Now, he and a lot of other farmers probably will.

 A drug implant was prescribed for an active 8-year-old girl diagnosed with central precocious puberty. The price of one option was thousands of dollars less than the other. Sudeep Taksali, an orthopedic surgeon, became worried that his 8-year-old daughter had already grown taller than his 12-year-old son. And sometimes she had an attitude that seemed more fitting for a teenager too. Something seemed wrong. Taksali and his wife, Sara, realized their daughter had grown 7 inches in two years and she was showing signs of puberty. They took her to the doctor, who referred her to a pediatric endocrinologist for a work-up. Eventually, their daughter was diagnosed with central precocious puberty. It's a rare condition that meant she would go through sexual development years earlier than her peers and would likely stop growing abnormally early too. Taksali and his wife adopted the girl from India two years ago, and overall, she is adjusting well in their community just outside Portland, Ore. Share your medical billing story Do you have a medical bill you'd like us to investigate? You can tell us about it and submit it here. She's a bright, avid reader who loves to do kettlebell workouts with her dad and Zumba with her mom. Still, she has moved across the world and learned a new language. And, he notes, she is a child of color in their mostly white community just outside Portland. "Having one more thing for her to deal with ... where there might be maybe some negative attention drawn to her changing body," Taksali says. "That was one of my big concerns." On the advice of their daughter's doctors, the Taksalis decided to put her early puberty on hold. The recommended treatment is a product commonly known as a hormone blocker. Implanted beneath the skin in her arm, it releases a little bit of a drug each day that increases the body's production of some hormones while it decreases others. The result is the child's progression toward adulthood slows. The doctors told them there were two nearly identical drug implants — each containing 50 mg of histrelin acetate — made by the same company, Endo Pharmaceuticals, an American drugmaker domiciled in Ireland. But one was considerably cheaper. Taksali wanted his daughter to get the less expensive option, but his insurer said it would cover only the more expensive option. Resigned, he asked the hospital how much it would charge for the expensive drug he had been hoping to avoid. Then the estimated bill came. The patient: Sudeep Taksali's daughter, 8, whom NPR is not naming to protect her medical privacy. She is insured through her father's high-deductible UnitedHealthcare plan. Total estimated bill: The hospital told Taksali that the insurer wouldn't cover the cheaper version of the drug, Vantas. After that, he spent hours trying to get an estimated bill before the implantation. Supprelin LA would cost around $95,000, plus the cost of implantation, the hospital's billing department told him. Under his health plan, he has a $5,000 deductible and 20% coinsurance, so he was worried how much he might owe. Service provider: OHSU Hospital in Portland, Ore., part of Oregon Health & Science University. Medical procedure: implantation of a drug-delivery device containing 50 mg of histrelin acetate, to stave off early puberty. What gives: Supprelin LA was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2007 for central precocious puberty and has a list price of $37,300, according to pricing data from ConnectureDRX. Vantas was approved by the FDA in 2004 for late-stage prostate cancer and has a list price of $4,400. Doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines for treatments that haven't been approved by the FDA, something called off-label use. The main difference between the two medicines is that Supprelin LA releases 65 micrograms of the drug a day and Vantas releases 50 micrograms a day. Each implant lasts about a year. The 15-microgram reduction in daily dose with Vantas is less than the weight of an eyelash, and the doctors who recommended the treatment said it doesn't make a clinical difference for children with central precocious puberty. The much higher price for the children's version of the drug grated on Taksali, whose surgery practice is in Salem, Ore. "From a parent standpoint, as a physician, as a consumer, it feels abusive," he says. "There's sort of a predation on parents who have that sense of vulnerability, who will do anything within their means to help their children and who will sacrifice for themselves or their family, for their children's physical well-being." 
                Sudeep Taksali, an orthopedic surgeon, found it frustrating to get answers about pricing and coverage from his insurer, UnitedHealthcare, before his daughter's procedure.

 Sudeep Taksali, an orthopedic surgeon, found it frustrating to get answers about pricing and coverage from his insurer, UnitedHealthcare, before his daughter's procedure. Why did the FDA essentially approve the same drug twice? FDA spokeswoman Brittney Manchester said by email, "Generally, it is the sponsor's decision." The sponsor is the drugmaker, Endo. Indeed, other drugmakers have sought approval for a single chemical compound as two different drugs. For example, Pfizer makes two versions of sildenafil citrate: Viagra for erectile dysfunction and Revatio for pulmonary arterial hypertension. When we asked Endo Pharmaceuticals why Supprelin LA and Vantas had such different price tags, the company said the implants aren't identical and treat very different conditions. It didn't respond to questions about why that meant the prices should be different and whether it was somehow more expensive to manufacture one than the other. Resolution:  Taksali spent more than a month trying to make sure his daughter could use the cheaper drug, and finally, the week his daughter was scheduled to have the procedure, it was approved. The hospital submitted the request again, and UnitedHealthcare said it would cover it. "Our coverage policies are aligned with FDA regulations and Vantas is not FDA approved to treat Central Precocious Puberty," said UnitedHealthcare spokeswoman Tracey Lempner in an email. "In this specific case, when the provider expressed concern over the cost of Supprelin LA, we worked with them to allow for coverage of Vantas." Taksali's daughter got the Vantas implant in late January. When he got a breakdown of charges afterward, it listed $608 for the implantation and $12,598.47 for Vantas — about three times its list price. "The price indicated on a patient statement often does not reflect what OHSU or any other hospital is paid for providing medical care, and in most cases, it doesn't reflect the amount the patient will be responsible for paying," said OHSU spokesperson Tracy Brawley. According to his explanation of benefits, Taksali will owe, after insurance, $4,698.45 — most of his high deductible. Because it is early in the year, the family had not spent any of its 2020 deductible yet. "One of the most mind-blowing things about this whole story is I probably will end up spending a very similar amount of money based on my insurance between Vantas and Supprelin," he said. Taksali said he fought for the lower-cost drug on principle. "Even if it is the insurance company's money, it's still somebody's money," he said. "We are still contributing to those premium dollars." For now, it is unclear how much, if anything, UnitedHealthcare will pay toward the drug. Taksali seems to owe a little more than the list price of the drug. "It will be interesting to see what happens," Merrit Quarum, the CEO of health care consulting firm WellRithms, wrote in an email. "Besides high charges, these types of systems and process problems add to the overall aggravations with healthcare payers and the patient continues to be caught in the middle with no advocate."

 Reading a book after school at her family's home. The takeaway: If you need an expensive drug, the first thing you should do is ask your doctor if there are cheaper alternatives. Sometimes, generics are available at a fraction of the cost. Other times, there are other cheaper brand-name options. If you don't find out a drug is too expensive until you get to the pharmacy counter, you can also ask the pharmacist about less expensive options. And there are websites like GoodRx and Drugs.com that can help you compare prices of similar products. Patients, their families and health care providers can appeal these decisions, though it can be time consuming. For Taksali, using social media to direct-message UnitedHealthcare garnered prompt responses and some answers. If there aren't other options, drug manufacturers often offer coupons to help patients with their copays. You can find some using GoodRx or visiting the drugmaker's website directly.

 Hiroki Koga, co-founder of the Oishii Farm in New Jersey, cultivated the Omakase berry, which is distinguished by its strong aroma and sweetness. He says he was unimpressed with the quality of produce in the U.S. A new berry variety described as melt-in-your-mouth creamy is tingling taste buds in New York. Chefs at high-end restaurants in Manhattan are dropping $50 on an eight-pack of the Japanese designer variety known as the "Omakase berry." At $6.25 per berry, that's about 10 times more expensive than an average pack found at an American grocery store that contains at least twice as many berries.  Hiroki Koga, co-founder of the Oishii Farm in New Jersey — the only place in the U.S. where the variety is grown — says his buyers are paying for the quality. The Japanese phrase omakase translates as "I leave it to the chef," Koga told NPR's Weekend All Things Considered. "When you go to a restaurant and say 'omakase course,' you basically can't choose anything that day, and you'll have to let the chef give you what's in its best condition in that season." Koga is originally from Japan, a country known for its tasty, luxury fruit, where a single pear can cost $10, or a melon can sell for $100. So when Koga moved to the U.S. in 2015, he says he was disappointed with the quality of the produce. "I quickly learned it was because agriculture in this country is really optimized for yield and quantity as opposed to quality, which is very different from Japan, where quality comes before everything else," he said. He was especially bothered by the taste of American strawberries. "It almost reminded me of cucumbers," he said. "That was the moment I thought, OK, if I can find a way to grow Japanese variety strawberries somehow, I might be able to share the experience with people outside of my country." He started that journey by returning to Japan to find the perfect strain of strawberry to bring to the U.S. He says he ate through some 50 different berries before he came across a particular variety, distinguished by its strong aroma and exceptional sweetness. It has twice as much sugar content compared to the average American variety. The Omakases are bigger, and have an airier texture and unexposed seeds. "When you bite into it, the aroma just spreads into your mouth," Koga said. "Our customers say when they leave a tray of our strawberry in their room, and they come back after two or three minutes, the entire room smells like strawberry." But that strawberry strain thrives in the mountains of Japan — not so much in the New York metro area. So Koga, along with co-founder Brendan Somerville, spent six months building an indoor vertical farm that could replicate its natural growing conditions. Getting it just to his liking was an arduous process. "We were sleeping on the floor of the farm. It was very rough," he said. "We had experts from Japan giving us insights on what kind of temp, humidity and levels of CO2 and wind speed we should be targeting inside the farm." Now, the Omakase berries are featured on the menus of several Michelin star restaurants in Manhattan. Yuki Minakawa, the beverage and service director for New York City's Sushi Ginza Onodera, says the strawberry is so unique and flavorful that chefs prefer to serve it on its own. The new fruit has been well-received by customers too, she added. "I've even seen a customer retrieving their seeds. And I believe that customer will be planting those seeds when they get home." Hiroki Koga says company plans to eventually lower the berry price as it transitions to retail distribution. But for now, he says, the price tag reflects the unique product consumers are receiving, including hand-delivery, the story behind the berry and its consistent quality. "It's really not just the berry that we're selling, but the experience," he said. With 1,000 people on Oishii's waitlist as of last month, it seems there are plenty of customers willing to pay for that experience.

 MICHAEL MILKEN IN LOS ANGELES (Photo by Ted Soqui/Sygma via Getty Images) In the 80s, Michael Milken transformed the economy by unleashing billions of dollars of junk bonds. It changed the way we treated corporations, and funded entirely new industries. He was richly rewarded for his vision: At one point, he was making more money than anybody in America. But he made some decisions that landed him in prison, for two years.  Last week, however, President Donald Trump pardoned him. From finance intern to felon, Michael Milken is the classic American redemption story, with a twist — he's a billionaire. In this episode: How did Milken make so much money, why did he end up in prison, and how'd he get that pardon? Music: "Bozz" "Mystery Inc" and "Discover".

The Indicator The Candidates Should Be Talking About,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/21/808289804/the-indicator-the-candidates-should-be-talking-about,February 21, 2020, The Democratic hopefuls duked it out in a fiery debate this week. Economic issues of all stripes came up, but political economist Jared Bernstein says the economic indicator he's been thinking about lately didn't come up at all: the savings rate for U.S. households. It's a lot higher than it has been in the past. Nobody knows exactly why this is happening and though this could be considered a good thing, it might be a sign that people are worried about the future and too much savings could have a negative impact on the all important U.S. consumer spending. It also highlights some of the issues of inequality that many of the candidates have been talking about. Today on the show, we look into the household savings rate and why Jared thinks it's so important right now.  Music by Drop Electric. Find us: Twitter / Facebook / Newsletter.

 Authorities say Wells Fargo bank managers were aware of illegal conduct as early as 2002 but allowed it to continue until 2016. Wells Fargo has agreed to pay $3 billion to settle charges that the bank engaged in fraudulent sales practices for more than a decade.  The company acknowledged collecting millions of dollars in fees for bank accounts, debit cards and other products that customers neither asked for nor needed. The illegal practices were carried out by thousands of Wells Fargo employees in order to meet unrealistic sales targets.  "When companies cheat to compete, they harm customers and other competitors," Deputy Assistant Attorney General Michael Granston said in a statement.   The $3 billion penalty is appropriate, "given the staggering size, scope and duration of Wells Fargo's illicit conduct," added Andrew Murray, U.S. attorney for the Western District of North Carolina.  Authorities say bank managers were aware of the illegal conduct as early as 2002 but allowed it to continue until 2016.  "This case illustrates a complete failure of leadership at multiple levels within the Bank," said Nick Hanna, U.S. attorney for the Central District of California. "Simply put, Wells Fargo traded its hard-earned reputation for short-term profits, and harmed untold numbers of customers along the way." The Justice Department says a cornerstone of Wells Fargo's business model during this period was a "cross-sell strategy," in which existing customers were encouraged to open additional accounts and buy other financial products. In order to meet onerous sales targets, prosecutors say employees often opened accounts without customers' knowledge or consent — forging signatures, moving money from existing accounts and altering customers' contact information to avoid detection. "We are hopeful that this $3 billion penalty, along with the personnel and structural changes at the Bank, will ensure that such conduct will not reoccur," Hanna said.  Wells Fargo reported net income of $2.9 billion in its most recent quarter. "The conduct at the core of today's settlements — and the past culture that gave rise to it — are reprehensible and wholly inconsistent with the values on which Wells Fargo was built," CEO Charlie Scharf said in a statement.  "We are committing all necessary resources to ensure that nothing like this happens again."  None of the $3 billion penalty will go to Wells Fargo customers. The bulk of the fine will go to the U.S. Treasury, while $500 million will go to the Securities and Exchange Commission to be distributed to investors. Previous fines and settlements have gone to customers who suffered financial harm, including downgrades of their credit ratings. The bank has made additional payments to settle complaints over mortgage abuses and the sale of unnecessary auto insurance.  In addition to the civil penalties, the Justice Department agreed to defer criminal prosecution of Wells Fargo, as long as the bank meets certain conditions for three years. Authorities noted that the bank has already made significant changes to its management and board of directors.   The settlement does not preclude additional action against individuals who took part in the illegal scheme.

 Shake Shack shortened managers' workweeks to four days at some stores a year and a half ago. Recently, the burger chain expanded the trial to a third of its U.S. stores. Companies around the world are embracing what might seem like a radical idea: a four-day workweek. The concept is gaining ground in places as varied as New Zealand and Russia, and it's making inroads among some American companies. Employers are seeing surprising benefits, including higher sales and profits. The idea of a four-day workweek might sound crazy, especially in America, where the number of hours worked has been climbing and where cellphones and email remind us of our jobs 24/7. But in some places, the four-day concept is taking off like a viral meme. Many employers aren't just moving to 10-hour shifts, four days a week, as companies like Shake Shack are doing; they're going to a 32-hour week — without cutting pay. In exchange, employers are asking their workers to get their jobs done in a compressed amount of time. Last month, a Washington state senator introduced a bill to reduce the standard workweek to 32 hours. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev is backing a parliamentary proposal to shift to a four-day week. Politicians in Britain and Finland are considering something similar. In the U.S., Shake Shack started testing the idea a year and a half ago. The burger chain shortened managers' workweeks to four days at some stores and found that recruitment spiked, especially among women. Shake Shack's president, Tara Comonte, says the staff loved the perk: "Being able to take their kids to school a day a week, or one day less of having to pay for day care, for example." So the company recently expanded its trial to a third of its 164 U.S. stores. Offering that benefit required Shake Shack to find time savings elsewhere, so it switched to computer software to track supplies of ground beef, for example. "It was a way to increase flexibility," Comonte says of the shorter week. "Corporate environments have had flexible work policies for a while now. That's not so easy to do in the restaurant business." Hundreds — if not thousands — of other companies are also adopting or testing the four-day week. Last summer, Microsoft's trial in Japan led to a 40% improvement in productivity, measured as sales per employee. Much of this is thanks to Andrew Barnes, an archaeologist by training, who never intended to become a global evangelist. "This was not a journey I expected to be on," he says. Barnes is CEO of Perpetual Guardian, New Zealand's largest estate planning company. He spent much of his career believing long hours were better for business. But he was also disturbed by the toll it took on employees and their families, particularly when it came to mental health. So two years ago, he used Perpetual Guardian and its 240 workers as guinea pigs, partnering with academic researchers in Auckland to monitor and track the effects of working only four days a week. "Core to this is that people are not productive for every hour, every minute of the day that they're in the office," Barnes says, which means there was lots of distraction and wasted time that could be cut. Simply slashing the number and duration of meetings saved huge amounts of time. Also, he did away with open-floor office plans and saw workers spending far less time on social media. All this, he says, made it easier to focus more deeply on the work. Remarkably, workers got more work done while working fewer hours. Sales and profits grew. Employees spent less time commuting, and they were happier. Barnes says there were other, unexpected benefits: It narrowed workplace gender gaps. Women — who typically took more time off for caregiving — suddenly had greater flexibility built into their schedule. Men also had more time to help with their families, Barnes says. The company didn't police how workers spent their time. But if performance slipped, the firm could revert back to the full-week schedule. Barnes says that alone motivated workers. The Perpetual Guardian study went viral, and things went haywire for Barnes. Employers — including big multinationals — started calling, seeking advice. "Frankly, I couldn't drink enough coffee to deal with the number of companies that approached us," Barnes says. Demand was so great that he set up a foundation to promote the four-day workweek. Ironically, in the process, he's working a lot of overtime. "You only get one chance to change the world. And, it's my responsibility at least, on this one, to see if I can influence the world for the better," he says. To date, most of that interest has not come from American employers. Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, says that's because the concept runs counter to American notions of work and capitalism. Unions are less powerful, and workers have less political sway than in other countries, he says. So American companies answer to shareholders, who tend to prioritize profit over worker benefits. "I just don't see contemporary U.S. employers saying, 'You know what, if we create more value here, we're gonna give it to the employees.' I just don't see that happening," Cappelli says. Natalie Nagele, co-founder and CEO of Wildbit, has heard from other leaders who say it didn't work for them. She says it fails when employees aren't motivated and where managers don't trust employees. But Nagele says moving her Philadelphia software company to a four-day week three years ago has been a success. "We had shipped more features than we had in recent years, we felt more productive, the quality of our work increased. So then we just kept going with it," Nagele says. Personally, she says, it gives her time to rest her brain, which helps solve complex problems: "You can ask my team, there's multiple times where somebody is like, 'On Sunday morning, I woke up and ... I figured it out.' " Mikeal Parlow started working a four-day week about a month ago. It was a perk of his new job as a budget analyst in Westminster, Colo. He works 10 hours a day, Monday through Thursday. Or, as he puts it, until the job is done. Parlow says he much prefers the new way "because it is about getting your work done, more so than feeding the clock." That frees Fridays up for life's many delightful chores — like visits to the DMV. "For instance, today we're going to go and get our license plates," Parlow says. But that also leaves time on the weekends ... for the weekend.

 When filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September, Forever 21 had stated that it planned to reorganize the business and would likely close up to 178 U.S. stores. Forever 21, the fast-fashion mall standby that filed for bankruptcy last year, will live on. Three companies announced Wednesday that they are jointly acquiring the retailer aimed at young shoppers and that they plan to continue to operate its U.S. and international stores. The buyers are Authentic Brands Group, which owns major brands such as Barneys New York, Aeropostale and Nine West; and real estate companies Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners.   "Forever 21 is a powerful retail brand with incredible consumer reach and a wealth of untapped potential," Jamie Salter, CEO of ABG, said in a statement. Forever 21 currently has 593 stores globally.   The deal is valued at $81.1 million, according to court records, and officially closed on Wednesday. When the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September, Forever 21 had stated that it planned to reorganize the business and would likely close up to 178 U.S. stores.  But while the company said at the time that it planned to shut down stores in Asia and Europe, the new owners say they hope to expand in "South America, Western and Eastern Europe, China, Southeast Asia, Middle East, and India." Forever 21 was founded by Korean immigrants in Los Angeles more than 30 years ago and, until now, has described itself as a "family-owned business." It enjoyed rapid expansion in the 2000s but has struggled as mall customers have dwindled. Other companies that were common sights in malls during the 1990s and 2000s such as Wet Seal and American Apparel have faced similar struggles.  "Consumers are not spending like they used to, and that has made things more competitive," NPR's Planet Money recently reported. "And in this more competitive environment, Forever 21 has been losing ground to the new crop of online retailers — companies like boohoo, ASOS, Revolve and Lulus." ABG and Simon will each own 37.5% of the company's intellectual property and operating businesses, while Brookfield will own 25%. The new owners plan to keep the company's headquarters in LA.  ABG says it plans to seek out young customers "by introducing refreshed creative, targeted digital campaigns, and influential collaborations." 
Timecard Capitalists,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/20/807828611/timecard-capitalists,February 20, 2020, Once upon a time — or at least, once upon the 19th century — there were those who earned money from owning stuff, and those earned money from working.  But the economy has obviously evolved since then. Salaries, especially for high skill occupations, have climbed, making it easier for workers to save money. And the democratization of capital markets — e.g. the widespread access to owning stocks and bonds — has also made it easier for workers to build up their wealth.  Furthermore, the nature of work itself has changed, with many jobs becoming less physically arduous, more diversified and intellectually stimulating, and in many ways more prestigious than the jobs of the past.  One consequence of this evolution is that, more and more, the people who make the highest incomes from capital are the same people who make the highest incomes from labor. Branko Milanovic, author of the new book, Capitalism, Alone, has coined a term to describe this trend: homoploutia, from the Greek words "same" and "wealth".  Today on the show, what are the societal implications of a world in which the highest wage-earners are the same people who make the most from the assets they own? How will it affect income inequality? And how should policymakers respond to it? Music by Drop Electric. Find us: Twitter / Facebook / Newsletter.

The Most Dangerous Economist,https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/02/20/807790520/the-most-dangerous-economist,February 20, 2020, Editor's note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here.  In 1954, CIA director Allen Dulles recruited an economist, Richard Bissell, as his special assistant. It was the start of one of the strangest roles an economist has played in American history.  Bissell did not set out to be a spy. He did undergrad at Yale, studied at the London School of Economics, and then returned to Yale to get his PhD in economics. After graduating in 1939, he became a professor there and then at MIT.  Like so many of his generation, Bissell left his day job for government service during World War II. With an impressive resume, big brains, and an upper-class New England pedigree, Bissell went to Washington, DC, and met the right people. They were called "the Georgetown Set" for their swanky parties in the affluent Georgetown neighborhood.  In 1948, Bissell became a chief administrator of the Marshall Plan, and he designed many of the wonky details of distributing its funds. We recently made an episode about the plan, and it's how we got interested in Bissell. In November 1948, he met with Frank Wisner, then head of the CIA's covert operations arm. Wisner wanted Marshall Plan money for covert actions against communists in Europe. "When I began to press him about how the money would be used, he explained that I could not be told," Bissell later recalled. Bissell, nonetheless, diverted funds to them.  After getting recruited by the CIA, Bissell's first major job was developing the U2 spy plane, which was designed to take pictures of Soviet military assets from 70,000 feet. It became a major source of U.S. intelligence. In 1960, the Soviet Union shot down a U2 plane over their airspace, causing a diplomatic catastrophe for President Eisenhower.

 U2 Spy Plane As the U2 was being built, Bissell needed to find a secret air base. On April 12, 1955, Bissell flew over southern Nevada looking for a potential location. He spotted what he believed would be the perfect spot: a dry salt flat in southern Nevada called Groom Lake. The base would become known as Area 51, and it has long been a launch pad for UFO conspiracy theories ever since.  After getting the U2 program going, Bissell helped develop America's first spy satellites, and CIA leaders clearly saw potential in him. Despite being an economist, they selected Bissell in 1959 to become the CIA's Deputy Director of Plans. Now second-in-command at the agency, Bissell took over planning cloak-and-dagger operations around the world. The CIA was ambitious in those years. Bissell oversaw coups of democratically-elected leaders from Guatemala to the Congo. "Many of us who joined the CIA did not feel bound in the actions we took as staff members to observe all the ethical rules," Bissell later recalled.  In 1960, Bissell and other CIA leaders grew obsessed with "eliminating" Fidel Castro in Cuba. Bissell recruited American mobsters to kill him. They were game but couldn't get it done. One of Bissell's schemes involved trying to get poison pills into Castro's food at a Havana restaurant, but the plan never materialized. Simultaneously, Bissell wanted US-allied Cuban exiles to invade the country and overthrow the government. Bissell conceived of and pushed for the invasion during the Eisenhower administration, and he continued planning it after President John F. Kennedy was elected. Kennedy had reservations about the invasion, and insisted on circumscribing the mission and making sure the United States could deny involvement if it failed. There were many reasons to believe it would. The invading force was only about 1,500 people, and Bissell counted on them to inspire mass uprising across the country. The president, nonetheless, gave the go-ahead, and the men landed at the Bay of Pigs on April 17, 1961. It was an infamous disaster. The Cuban exiles were slaughtered and it in part led to the Soviet plan to ship nuclear missiles to Cuba.

 The Bay of Pigs invasion Kennedy had planned to promote Bissell to CIA director. But, an embarrassed Kennedy demoted Bissell and fired his boss, CIA director Allen Dulles. Bissell long harbored resentment towards Kennedy for not fully committing to the invasion, and, in 1962, he resigned from the CIA. Nonetheless, President Kennedy awarded him the National Security Medal, calling his contributions "unique." Bissell never went back into academic economics. But he did use his economics training as an executive at a defense contractor called United Aircraft Corporation (now United Technologies Corporation). When he died in 1994, newspapers mostly remembered him for his role in the Bay of Pigs. But, more broadly, he could be remembered as having one of the strangest careers of an economist ever.

 Calvin Brandford (center) is a certified minority contractor who has run an excavation business north of Boston for almost 30 years. Brandford said getting state-funded work as a subcontractor is very hard and often comes with a serious drawback: not getting paid for 60 to 90 days. State and local governments spend billions of dollars hiring contractors for goods and services, but most of those contracts go to white-owned businesses, not minority contractors — despite decades of affirmative action and other policies meant to make up for disparities. A federal study released by the Minority Business Development Agency in early 2017 found the needle has barely moved on boosting minority business participation in public contracts. Albert Shen, the former deputy chief of minority business development under President Obama, believes one reason is that government procurement officials just hire who they know. "The people that manage these large projects are — to be blunt — very homogeneous. They don't have diverse networks, so they don't know who to reach out to," Shen said. "[But] because they don't know doesn't mean they don't exist." There are more than 11 million minority owned businesses in the U.S. In places such as Massachusetts, minority entrepreneurs are now getting a smaller slice of the pie when it comes to doing business with local government. Over the last two decades, adjusted for inflation, the value of Massachusetts contracts going to minority-owned businesses has fallen 24%. That's $135 million less per year paid to minority entrepreneurs.  "The smart thing to do" In Massachusetts and many other states, public projects are required to hire a certain percentage of minority and women-owned businesses.  But Larry Cole, who runs a trucking company in Springfield, Mass., said there's very little oversight to make sure that happens. In 2007, a construction company promised him hundreds of hours of work as a minority subcontractor but Cole got only a fraction of the work – despite sometimes showing up onsite with trucks and drivers.  "You've got to feed a family. At that time, I had three kids in college, plus the trucks, the insurance, payroll taxes," said Cole, remembering how he challenged the construction company when they turned him and his dump trucks away. "I said, 'Wait, I'm supposed to be doing all the trucking here.' Well, next thing you know, you're not doing it."

 Lionel Henry (right), who works for a minority-owned contracting firm, repairs the roof of an outdoor hockey rink at Philadelphia's Fishtown Recreation Center in December 2019. The project was part of a Philadelphia effort to expand participation of minority contractors in city-funded construction jobs. Cole's trucking company shrank, he said, partly because of his frustration of getting work in the public sector.  Massachusetts' leaders began decades ago trying to fix economic disparities facing minority businesspeople such as Cole, passing laws and creating agencies to even the playing field. Last fall, Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito praised efforts to boost minority participation in building two casinos approved by the state.  "The one thing the Mass Gaming Commission did was to be intentional to diversify their workforce — setting these goals, holding everyone accountable, measuring progress," she said. James Jennings, an expert on race and politics and an emeritus professor at Tufts University, said the state's efforts to increase fairness and equity for minority business owners aren't cutting it. "The pushing has been going on for 25 to 30 years now," Jennings said. "I think leadership has to be more aggressive in saying we're going to do something about this because it's the right thing to do (and) it's also economically the smart thing to do." Inclusive and equitable Critics in Massachusetts have pointed to Philadelphia as a model for local government getting more aggressive about hiring minority contractors. On a raw December afternoon in North Philadelphia, a dozen kids are chasing a soccer ball on a blacktop basketball court on a city-owned playground slated for renovation. It's part of a $400 million initiative aimed at fixing up recreation centers, parks and libraries in low-income neighborhoods like this one. The city of Philadelphia also intends to spend a third of that money hiring businesses owned by minorities to do the work. "These poor communities that are mostly minority in the city of Philadelphia: It makes a lot of sense that if you have people coming in and working and fixing things and designing things, let them look like [local people]," said Cappy Sabir, an engineer and minority business owner whose company is working a new vision for this playground. "You're giving a level of motivation and pride to the community. 'See? I can be an architect. I can be an engineer, I can be a contractor.'" Sabir is a co-owner of SRW Engineering & Architecture, which won five contracts with the city worth almost half a million dollars. City-wide, minority-owned businesses landed 23% of Philadelphia city contracts last year, totaling $166 million. Iola Harper, who heads up Philadelphia's office of economic opportunity, said Philadelphia's mayor — now in his second term — has prioritized contracting with minority businesses. "You really have to have buy-in from the top," Harper said. "The boss of the city, not their boss, but their boss's boss, expects that there's going to be some inclusion. They know that part of my evaluation or part of what my boss is looking at is my ability to be inclusive and be equitable." Underlying this mandate is simple economics, said Harper, especially in a city with a poverty rate at 26% — one of the country's highest for a big city.

 "Businesses that are owned by people of color hire people who look like them," she said. "That's people that are going to be employed and that's going to impact the poverty rate." Harper's office also sets minority hiring goals and enforces compliance. Since 2017, Philadelphia has disbarred three vendors from working with the city that violated minority contracting regulations. The city has also lowered barriers that have historically favored big contractors by offering assistance to smaller, minority-owned and women-owned firms before they even bid on projects. Sabir's company — with just 20 employees — took advantage of the city's new rules and is now treated as a prime contractor, not just a subcontractor that has to lobby other private businesses for a share of the work. "Opportunities come out from the city (were) worded in a way, structured in a way that is impossible for either for any minority, or woman-owned business to even have a chance," Sabir said. "Offering the opportunity for minority firms to be primes? To us, that's like Obama becoming president. It's huge." The huge change that Sabir has welcomed in Philadelphia, though, is not happening across the country. The federal report at the end of the Obama administration analyzed 100 disparity surveys done by cities and states across the country. The majority of those places found minority-owned businesses face significant disparities. President Trump's budget for next year calls for cutting the Minority Business Development Agency budget by 76%.

 Research & Development associate Divya Nagalati works on cell cultures in Regeneron's infectious disease labs in Tarrytown, N.Y. The firm is looking for tailored antibodies that might prove useful against the new coronavirus. Viral infections can be very hard to treat. Just ask anyone who has a bad case of the flu. But that's not deterring research groups around the world from looking for an effective therapy against the new coronavirus, although they know it won't be easy. "Every virus is sort of like a dysfunctional family," says Dr. Mark Denison, a virologist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. "They're dysfunctional in their own unique ways." There are two basic approaches to stopping viral infections. One is to block an enzyme the virus needs either to make copies of itself or infect cells. The other is to make a monoclonal antibody, based on a recovered patient's immune response. Researchers are already testing the first idea — with an experimental, broad-acting antiviral drug known as Remdesivir, which works by gumming up a virus's ability to replicate. The drug is being tested in China on patients who have COVID-19. A study published just last week found that Remdesivir successfully reduced respiratory symptoms in rhesus monkeys exposed to another coronavirus that causes serious disease — Middle East respiratory syndrome. In other work, the biopharmaceutical company Sirnaomics is hoping to use a gene-silencing technique known as RNA interference to turn off key genes in the new coronavirus. But first, the company must identify viral genes to target. "We are currently testing 150 of them using cell-based culture," says Patrick Lu, Sirnaomics president and CEO. "We are working with groups in the U.S. and China." Some drugs that are already through the FDA approval process may also have the desired blocking effect on one of the new virus's critical enzymes, scientists say. The second basic approach is to go after the virus with molecules derived from the immune system. The idea is to make what are called monoclonal antibodies, which are tailored proteins that are known to stop a particular virus. That's the approach of a Canadian biotech firm called AbCellera. "We're trying to identify antibodies from patients who have recovered from infection," says Ester Falconer, head of research and development at AbCellera, "because their finely tuned immune systems have already figured out a way to clear the virus." AbCellera is part of the Pandemic Prevention Platform, a program run by the federal Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The company has developed a rapid way to analyze the blood from a recovered patient. "We can very quickly — in less than a day — look through many millions of different immune cells," Falconer says, and find the antibodies that can be turned into a monoclonal drug therapy. The biotech firm Regeneron is also looking for such antibodies. To find them, the company is using mice that have been given what amounts to a human immune system. Regeneron's Christos Kyratsous says these mice make antibodies when exposed to a virus like the coronavirus — but they don't make mouse antibodies. "They are basically making fully human antibodies," Kyratsous says. "We've created a mini human immune response in a mouse." They've begun exposing the mice to a virus that mimics the new coronavirus. "The mice are mounting an immune response against these components as we speak," Kyratsous says. "Within the next few weeks, we should be able to start harvesting antibodies out of these mice and testing them" to see which ones will make the most effective drug. Vanderbilt's Mark Denison says it's not enough just to stop the virus — you also have to stop the damage to the lungs caused by the virus. Denison says it's tempting to try using anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids, but that can actually make things worse. "If we understood ways that the coronavirus has caused lung disease, we might be able to block that damage while we're treating the virus," Denison says. He's confident that understanding will come. The recent outbreak, he says, has underscored the need to come up with new ideas about how to treat outbreaks caused by new viruses, and he's optimistic new approaches will be found. "I don't think about a decade," he says. "I think about this in terms of right now we're in a position to try to move forward quickly with these ideas.

 Employees wait outside the Foxconn worker dormitories this week in Kunshan. China's factories are facing dire labor shortages and factory production lines are at a standstill. More than a month and a half into the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China, the country's economy is still largely in lockdown mode, stalling a global manufacturing powerhouse at the heart of nearly every industrial supply chain. As the crisis continues, businesses big and small are struggling with the disruption the pneumonia-like illness has caused, with effects reaching across the globe. Restaurants and stores have been forcibly shut, many with paper seals to prevent owners from covertly reopening. Factory production lines are at a standstill. Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, has twice extended its holiday break, keeping tens of millions at home in an effort to contain the virus. The death toll from COVID-19 now exceeds 2,000 people. "If this [outbreak] drags past March, that really becomes quite bad," says Tom Rafferty, China research head at the Economist Intelligence Unit. "Then you're talking about long-term dislocation in supply chains. You're talking about a negative impact on the consumer sector, which is not temporary. And when you factor all these things and perhaps a cooling housing market, you get some pretty nasty economic data." The dire labor shortages have been even more worrying. China's factories normally ramp up production right after the Lunar New Year, but this year few workers have returned. Most of China's migrant workers, who number some 300 million, remain cloistered in sealed-off villages and towns. Those who do manage to leave find themselves barred from renting places to stay near their workplaces by landlords fearful of travelers. In Kunshan, a city that is home to many migrant workers near Shanghai, labor shortages are glaringly evident. The city is home to massive factories operated by Foxconn and Pegatron, the titans of global electronics manufacturing and key suppliers for companies such as Apple.

 Restaurants and stores have been forcibly shut in Kunshan, many with paper seals to prevent owners from covertly reopening. Foxconn has declined to publicize which plants it is gradually reopening. In normal circumstances, these two Taiwan-based multinational electronics manufacturers together employ more than 1 million people across China. But nowadays, Kunshan's normally bustling industrial zone is empty and shops are shuttered. Employees tell NPR most workers haven't returned. Apple said Monday it expected its quarterly sales will fall short of its forecasts because of the coronavirus outbreak. A skeleton team of "winter break" or hanjia workers was hired to work over the Lunar New Year holiday. But the usual influx of migrant workers has not come to relieve them this year, and so the skeleton crews have extended their shifts indefinitely to staff factories that normally account for more than half of the world's electronics manufacturing revenues. "We have some real conflicts with labor supply right now ... the problem is we don't want to come to work. But our bosses haven't given us a choice," a 34-year-old skeleton crew member at Kunshan's Pegatron plant tells NPR. Like all of the dozen workers NPR spoke with, he declined to give his name for fear of retribution at work.

 A Pegatron plant in Kunshan. Pegatron and Foxconn normally employ more than 1 million people across China. "One production line used to have 4,000 people. Now there are about a dozen remaining. My own production line usually has 1,000 workers, with about 60 now remaining," says a female hanjia worker at Foxconn. Even a slight disruption in major supply chains commanded by multinational manufacturers like Foxconn and Pegatron could create secondary delays among their clients and suppliers, lasting for months in global sectors ranging from electronics to cars. Foreign carmakers have struggled to restart full production. This week, Toyota, GM, Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler were among those saying they were slowly restarting at least some of their China plants. Hyundai said it had reopened most of its China production after brief closures for lack of parts. A recent poll of American companies by Shanghai's American Chamber of Commerce found 78% said they didn't have enough staff to resume full production. Nearly half said the resulting shutdowns had impacted their global supply chains.

"The global ramifications are much bigger this time, because China has a much larger share of global GDP and is much more integrated into the global economy," says Rafferty of the EIU. Unlike after the outbreak of swine flu a decade ago, Rafferty says China today does not have the luxury of double-digit GDP growth to cushion the economic blow. Its economy grew last year at its slowest rate in nearly 30 years: "In 2010, China was able very quickly to recover with the help of exports and strong global demand. It doesn't really have that option these days." Labor shortages will also likely cascade throughout the electronics manufacturing sector for months to come, with the burden falling on smaller firms rather than giants such as Foxconn.

 A Foxconn plant in Kunshan. Foxconn is one of the titans of global electronics manufacturing and a key supplier for companies such as Apple. "Foxconn can basically get all the labor it needs in the next few months, but they might suck away the labor from smaller component makers, such that the Apples of the world may not necessarily have all the components they want for Foxconn to assemble," says Dan Wang, a technology analyst at the research firm Gavekal Dragonomics. "These supply chains are too well choreographed. Shortages are now going to be causing headaches for months." Foxconn is trying to get workers from uninfected areas back to its factories — but labor shortages will continue as local officials restrict the movement of migrant workers: "Even if you came back to the factory, you have to spend 14 days as quarantine," the female Foxconn employee says. "We have some longtime workers that haven't even returned." Instead, Pegatron and Foxconn have turned to another source of temporary labor: student workers, drawn from China's thousands of vocational colleges. During holidays, they intern as poorly paid assembly workers.

 A view of Kunshan just outside the Pegatron campus. Foxconn and Pegatron did suspend production briefly in early February, before reopening parts of their Kunshan plants on Feb. 10. But starting last week, most student workers have been heading back home. In Kunshan, dozens of them could be seen outside worker dormitories last week, waiting for transportation to the local high-speed train station. "We have to do two weeks' quarantine at home. If we leave now, the quarantine ends just in time for us to begin the delayed start of the spring semester [in] early March," says a former Pegatron intern who attends a vocational institute in Gansu province. Foxconn and Pegatron did suspend production briefly in early February, before reopening parts of their Kunshan plants on Feb. 10. The two firms run some of the largest factories in the world and local governments had an interest in getting them running again, at least in stages. Smaller manufacturers are having a harder time. A rare earths magnet maker that normally employs about 300 people in the city of Hangzhou, south of Kunshan, received permission to reopen from local authorities last week. The factory was able to begin manufacturing again with a skeleton crew after buying a large disinfectant machine. Rare earth magnets are used in everything from electronics to motors. For any factory to reopen now, "There's paperwork that has to be submitted to the local government, and that includes guaranteeing masks, some other protective gear that employees can wear, a disinfecting schedule," says manager Jen Ambrose, one of the few Americans who works at the magnet company. In other cities, some of the Chinese businesses that buy from or supply Ambrose's firm face different sets of hygiene requirements and have not yet gotten approval to begin work. The costs of labor shortages, broken supply chains and blanket bans on production are falling hardest on privately run small and medium-sized firms that, according to the national statistics bureau, together employ about 150 million people in China. A recent joint survey conducted by Beijing's Tsinghua and Peking universities showed about 85% of these firms can survive just three months with no revenues before going bankrupt. Particularly hard hit will be consumption-dependent sectors such as dining, tourism and retail, as residents eliminate outside activities in favor of isolation at home. "All these kinds of activities have been hammered, absolutely hammered," says Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at consultancy Oxford Economics. "Value chain and supply chain disruptions have much larger [impacts] than the China-U.S. trade friction," Huang Qifan, the well-respected former mayor of Chongqing, wrote last week. Huang warned the economic fallout from the state response to the outbreak will outweigh and outlast that of the U.S.-China trade war. "Once supply chains are relocated and replaced," he wrote, "it is extremely hard to get them back."

 A masked paramilitary policeman stands guard alone at a deserted Tiananmen Gate in Beijing following the coronavirus outbreak. China on Wednesday said it has revoked the press credentials of three U.S. reporters over a headline for an opinion column it deems racist and slanderous. Updated at 9:45 a.m. ET China's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday it is canceling the visas of three journalists working for The Wall Street Journal after what it said was a racist headline that appeared on an opinion piece about the coronavirus epidemic earlier this month. The move comes a day after the U.S. State Department designated five Chinese state media outlets as foreign government missions, thus treating them as extensions of Beijing and requiring them to share information on their U.S.-based employees and properties. On Wednesday, China's Foreign Ministry said it reserved "the right to take further measures in response" to the State Department decision. The Journal said the three reporters were its Deputy Bureau Chief Josh Chin, reporter Chao Deng, both U.S. nationals, and reporter Philip Wen, an Australian. The expulsions follow a Feb. 3 opinion piece cited by the ministry titled "China is the Real Sick Man of Asia," by Walter Russell Mead, a scholar at the conservative Hudson Institute and a professor at Bard College in New York. #Coronavirus won't be the last black swan to manifest in China, and its financial markets may be a greater danger than the wildlife markets. My latest @WSJopinion https://t.co/VTAMf2mV5t None of the three journalists targeted by Beijing contributed to the opinion piece in question. The term "sick man of Asia" was originally ascribed to China in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a pejorative referring to its weak internal governance and external position vis-à-vis European powers and the U.S. The recent opinion piece, or at least its headline, sparked a flurry of criticism in Chinese media. In a statement on Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the newspaper's editors "used such [a] racially discriminatory title, triggering indignation and condemnation among the Chinese people and the international community." "The Chinese side has lodged stern representations with WSJ and made our solemn position clear," the statement said. "China demands the WSJ recognize the severity of its mistake, make an official apology and hold the persons involved accountable. Meanwhile, we reserve the right to take further actions." The opinion piece called China's initial response to the coronavirus outbreak "less than impressive." While the Journal's editorial pages have long been seen as a bastion of conservatism, the journalism in its news pages has won plaudits for its objectivity and thoroughness. Although China has effectively expelled at least six other journalists since 2013 by refusing to renew their press credentials, it is rare to rescind a visa outright and unprecedented to cancel multiple visas from the same outlet. The six include another Journal reporter, Chun Han Wong, who was expelled from China when his press credentials were not renewed last August after he authored a story that cast the family of Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a negative light. The Foreign Correspondents Club of China, a professional association in Beijing, called the decision to expel the three Journal reporters "an extreme and obvious attempt by the Chinese authorities to intimidate foreign news organizations by taking retribution against their China-based correspondents." "China has evicted fair and talented journalists who have worked hard to bring unbiased, informative reports to their audiences and to understand China," the association said in a statement.
It's Not Just Hospitals That Are Quick To Sue Patients Who Can't Pay,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/02/19/798894062/its-not-just-hospitals-that-are-quick-to-sue-patients-who-cant-pay,February 19, 2020,

 Until very recently, the separate company that runs the emergency department at Nashville General Hospital was continuing to haul patients who couldn't pay medical bills into court. Nashville General Hospital is a safety net facility funded by the city. For a patient without insurance, this is supposed to be the best place to go in a city with many hospitals. But for those who are uninsured, it may have been the worst choice in 2019. Its emergency room was taking more patients to court for unpaid medical bills than any other hospital or practice in town. A WPLN investigation finds the physician-staffing firm that runs the ER sued 700 patients in Davidson County during 2019. They include patients such as Sonya Johnson, a 52-year-old social worker and single mother. By juggling her care between a nonprofit clinic and Nashville General, Johnson had figured out how to manage her health problems, even though she was, until recently, uninsured. In 2018, she went in to see her doctor, who charges patients on a sliding scale. Her tongue was swollen and she was feeling weak. The diagnosis? She was severely anemic. "He called me back that Halloween day and said, 'I need you to get to the emergency [room], stat — and they're waiting on you when you get there,' " she recalls. Nashville General kept her overnight and gave her a blood transfusion. They wanted to keep her a second night — but she was worried about the mounting cost, so asked to be sent home. Staying overnight even the one night meant she was admitted to the hospital itself, and the bill for that part of her care wasn't so bad, Johnson says. The institution's financial counselors offered a 75% discount, because of her strained finances and because her job didn't offer health insurance at the time. But emergency rooms are often run by an entirely separate entity. In Nashville General's case, the proprietor was a company called Southeastern Emergency Physicians. And that's the name on a bill that showed up in Johnson's mailbox months later for $2,700. "How in the world can I pay this company, when I couldn't even pay for health care [insurance]?" Johnson asks. 
                Social worker Sonya Johnson received a civil warrant to appear in court when the company that runs Nashville General Hospital's emergency room threatened to sue her over a $2,700 ER bill — long after she'd already negotiated a reduced payment schedule for the rest of her hospital stay.

 Social worker Sonya Johnson received a civil warrant to appear in court when the company that runs Nashville General Hospital's emergency room threatened to sue her over a $2,700 ER bill — long after she'd already negotiated a reduced payment schedule for the rest of her hospital stay. Johnson didn't recognize the name of the physician practice. A Google search doesn't help much. There's no particular website, though a list of Web pages that do turn up in such a search suggest the company staffs a number of emergency departments in the region. Johnson says she tried calling the number listed on her bill to see if she could get the same charity-care discount the hospital gave her, but she could only leave messages. And then came a knock at her apartment door over the summer. It was a Davidson County sheriff's deputy with a summons requiring Johnson to appear in court. "It's very scary," she says. "I mean, [I'm] thinking, what have I done? And for a medical bill?" Nashville General Hospital was no longer suing patients Being sued over medical debt can be a big deal because it means the business can get a court-ordered judgment to garnish the patient's wages, taking money directly from their paycheck. The strategy is meant to make sure patients don't blow off their medical debts. But this is not good for the health of people who are uninsured, says Bruce Naremore, the chief financial officer at Nashville General. "When patients owe money, and they feel like they're being dunned all the time, they don't come back to the hospital to get what they might need," he says. Under Naremore's direction in the past few years, Nashville General had stopped suing patients for hospital fees. He says it was rarely worth the court costs. But Southeastern Emergency Physicians — which, since 2016, has been contracted by the hospital to run and staff its emergency department — went the other way, filing more lawsuits against patients than ever in 2019. Naremore says the decision on whether to sue over emergency care falls to the company that staffs the ER, not Nashville General Hospital. "It's a private entity that runs the emergency room, and it's the cost of doing business," he says. "If I restrict them from collecting dollars, then my cost is going to very likely go up, or I'm going to have to find another provider to do it." This is a common refrain, says Robert Goff. He's a retired hospital executive and board member of RIP Medical Debt. The nonprofit helps patients who are trapped under a mountain of medical bills, which are the No. 1 cause of personal bankruptcy. "So the hospital sits there and says, 'Not my problem.' That's irresponsible in every sense of the word," Goff says. The practice of suing patients isn't new for Southeastern Emergency Physicians or its parent company, Knoxville-based TeamHealth. But such lawsuits have picked up in recent years, even as the company has stopped its practice of balance billing patients. TeamHealth is one of the two dominant ER staffing firms in the nation, running nearly 1 in 10 emergency departments in the United States. And its strategy of taking patients to court ramped up after it was purchased by the private equity giant Blackstone, according to an investigation by the journalism project MLK50 in Memphis. Under pressure from journalists, TeamHealth ultimately pledged to stop suing patients and to offer generous discounts to uninsured patients. Officials from TeamHealth declined WPLN's request for an interview to answer questions about how widespread its practice of suing patients for ER doctors' services and fees has been. "We will work with patients on a case by case basis to reach a resolution," TeamHealth said in an email. According to court records obtained by WPLN, the firm filed about 700 lawsuits against patients in Nashville in 2019. That's up from 120 in 2018 and just seven in 2017. Its only contract in the city is with Nashville General's ER, and the patients reached by WPLN say they were uninsured when they were sued. What's surprising to Mandy Pellegrin, who has been researching medical billing in Tennessee at the nonpartisan Sycamore Institute, is that it was all happening at Nashville General — where treating uninsured patients is part of the hospital's mission. "It is curious that a company that works for a hospital like that might resort to those sorts of actions," Pellegrin says. TeamHealth halts suits, pledges to drop cases As for Sonya Johnson — she eventually went to court and worked out a payment plan of $70 a month over three years. And now TeamHealth tells WPLN that its intent is to drop pending cases. "We will not file additional cases naming patients as defendants and will not seek further judgments," a TeamHealth spokesperson says in an emailed statement. "Our intent is not to have these pending cases proceed. We're working as expeditiously as possible on resolving individual outstanding cases." Johnson says she's been told that the lawsuit Southeastern Emergency Physicians filed against her will be dropped — but that she still owes the $2,700 bill.

 HSBC says it will shed about 35,000 jobs over the next three years. The firm wants to shift more focus to Asian markets. British bank HSBC announced plans Tuesday to cut nearly 15% of its global workforce — some 35,000 jobs — and shed $100 billion in investments as it refocuses on growth markets in Asia.  Interim CEO Noel Quinn says the world's seventh-largest bank had a resilient performance last year but that parts of the business, including Global Banking and investment markets in Europe and the U.S., "are not delivering acceptable returns."  "We are taking decisive action today to address those underperforming parts of the business, to redistribute capital to the growth opportunity, to simplify our business — and in so doing reduce the cost base of HSBC," Quinn said in a statement. "But it's for a purpose, and that purpose is to grow." HSBC, which is based in London but does most of its business in Asia, has dealt with many recent uncertainties, including Brexit, protests in Hong Kong , U.S.-China trade disputes and now the novel coronavirus, The Associated Press reports. The bank, which currently has 235,000 employees worldwide, says it is simplifying operations for "greater pace, greater agility and a less bureaucratic environment." Job reductions are expected to take place over three years through a mix of layoffs and attrition.  HSBC has about 10,000 employees in the U.S. and operates branches in California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington state.  Robert Sherman, an HSBC spokesperson for U.S. operations, said in a statement emailed to NPR that the bank is not sharing specific information on which jobs will be affected until those employees are notified.  However, Sherman said the bank will close about 80 branches this year in the U.S. alone, a reduction of about 30%. But he added that it will continue to open new branches on the West Coast to better serve the large Asian communities there. HSBC's troubles reflect trends in the wider banking industry, which is under pressure from low interest rates around the world, the AP noted. Banks tend to make less money when rates are low, as its squeezes their lending business. The bank's net profit fell 53%, to nearly $6 billion, last year, according to its annual report. HSBC also delivered an 8% return but hopes to reach returns of 10% to 12% in the next few years.  On news of the restructuring, HSBC stock fell more than 6% on the London Stock Exchange.
Ciao, Italia: Why Italy's Youth are Leaving in Droves,https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/02/18/807025154/ciao-italia-why-italys-youth-are-leaving-in-droves,February 18, 2020, Editor's note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics released its jobs report this month, and the numbers, again, are pretty good: the unemployment rate is at 3.6%, while the youth unemployment rate is around 8%. The numbers looked good to us. But to our winter intern, Bianca Giacobone, they seemed astonishingly low. That's because she is from Italy, where the economy has been stuck for decades. So we asked her to write about what it's like to be young and Italian these days.  Sometimes, when people ask me why on earth I left Italy, a beautiful country I'm lucky enough to call home, I drop a few numbers. Italy's youth unemployment rate – the rate of people under 25 years old looking for a job and not finding it –  is 28.6%  as of the last quarter of 2019, according to Eurostat, the European Statistical Office. By comparison, in November 2019 the Eurozone's youth unemployment rate overall was 15.6%. Here in the U.S. it's about 8%.  Perhaps more worryingly, the Italian rate of people aged 20-34 neither in employment nor in education and training, the so-called NEET rate, was 28.9% in 2018. It's the highest NEET rate in the Eurozone, which has an average of 16.5%. To put that more plainly, almost 1 in 3 Italians under 34 aren't really doing anything at all.  "The Italian economy is not growing," says Carlo Cottarelli, an Italian economist and former director of the International Monetary Fund. "The Italian per capita income is the same as it was 20 years ago. In terms of economic growth, this past decade has been the worst since 1861."  Like many economists, Cottarelli has a long list of reasons why Italy's economy is stuck, and they start with Italy's adoption of the common currency in 2002. "We didn't handle the transition to the Euro well," he says, explaining that a common rate of exchange meant Italy couldn't lower prices to compete with Germany. "Since we couldn't devalue, we lost competitiveness." Then there are the usual suspects: excess of bureaucracy, one of the slowest civil justice processes in Europe, high levels of tax avoidance, high levels of corruption, a crippling economic division between North and South, and one of the lowest fertility rates in the world. "All these things, including an underfunded public education, condition the country's growth."  In the long term, high youth unemployment can lead to loss of skills and human capital. In the short term, youth unemployment shapes the lives of young Italians dramatically. For example, people tend to live with their parents longers – 66.1% of people aged 18-34 still lived with their parents in 2018, while the percentage in United States is roughly 30%. Young Italians struggle to reach financial independence. They have children late, which contributes to Italy having one of the worst fertility rates in the world. And, then they leave, as I did.   Many Italians blame the education system, which is chronically underfunded, and favors theory over practice, leading to a very slow school-to-work transition, and to a mismatch between what young people graduate in and the skills needed to find work.  Graduating with degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (STEM) leads to better employment prospects. But my father's reminder that it would be best to study engineering fell on deaf years when I was 19 and fresh out of high school. I enrolled in the Humanities, as many other Italians before and after me.  Anecdotally, I can say that the overwhelming majority of the friends and acquaintances living back home, all over 25 years old, do not have jobs and/or are still living with their parents. And that around 20% of my small high school graduating class, me included, is now living abroad, and that five out of five of my cousins under 30 years old are not working in Italy at the moment. Friends have gone to the United Kingdom, Germany, Portugal, South Africa, and the United States, among many others. They're pursuing Phds, working as managers, servers, engineers, professors, chefs, and architects.  We all look longingly back at our country, wondering when and if there'll be a good moment to go back, and have a job and a career comparable to the one we can have abroad. Because, as most of the world knows, Italy is a beautiful country, where the coffee is cheap, the food is good, holidays are long, education is mostly free, and there is universal health care, despite all the economic trouble.  Davide Fikri Kamel, who comes from Corvino San Quirico, a bucolic village in the north of Italy, and works a well paid job with Amazon's digital marketing division in New York City, is used to his colleagues' surprise at his desire to leave Italy. "Every time I show pictures and videos of my village, to my coworkers and friends they're like, 'Why on earth would you move out of this dreamy, heavenly place?'" he says. "But you don't know what the struggle is, you don't know how the Italian education system is, you don't know what the job situation is."  "Some 2 million young Italians – many of them educated and skilled – have left Italy since 2008," says Nicola Nobile, an economist at the research and analytics consultancy Oxford Economics. That's a lot in a country with a population of about 60 million. Immigration, which could help counteract the low fertility rate, is relatively recent in Italy – under 3% of Italy's population were immigrants before 2000, a number that now lingers around 10% – and so far it's not well received.   "A country that cannot keep its youth is not forward looking," says Nobile. "There are more older voters than young, so politicians tend to focus their politics and economic incentives on them. It's a country for old people."  I am reminded of that every time I go back home to Milan and go for a walk. People around the streets, in bars, shops and cafes, are strikingly older than what I'm used to now that I live in New York.  I like to think I'll be back. I've written down a ten year plan. I'll work for a few years abroad, here in the United States, or somewhere in Europe, and build my career. Then, when my resume is appealing enough, I'll move back and be of use. It's a plan that comes less out of patriotic duty, and more out of a refusal to accept displacement. Yes, that's my dream, to work in the country where I grew up.  Did you enjoy this newsletter?

'Dark Towers' Chases Scandal-Ridden Deutsche Bank's Mysterious Ties To Donald Trump,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/18/806984703/dark-towers-is-a-cautionary-tale-of-pursuing-profits-at-any-cost,February 18, 2020, Deutsche Bank, Donald Trump, and an Epic Trail of Destruction by David Enrich Hardcover, 402 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Some of the world's largest and most powerful banks spent the past decade mired in scandal, but none descended as far into ignominy as Germany's Deutsche Bank. Its rap sheet includes a staggering array of ethical and legal lapses, including money laundering, tax fraud and sanctions violations — not to mention mysterious ties to President Trump that federal investigators are even now looking into. How this plodding, conservative bank from a country famous for diligence and thrift turned into the most infamous casino on Wall Street is the subject of David Enrich's excellent, deeply reported book Dark Towers: Deutsche Bank, Donald Trump, and an Epic Trail of Destruction. It is by now a familiar story. "This proud national icon was seduced by the siren song of Wall Street riches," Enrich writes. Thanks partly to deregulation, big firms such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch were coming up with tantalizing new ways to make money, and by 1994 Deutsche Bank wanted a piece of the action. It started by recruiting Edson Mitchell, an American executive from Merrill, who believed Deutsche Bank's "stubborn Germanness was the main impediment to unleashing its full animal spirits." Mitchell set about building a global markets operation, not at the bank's Frankfurt headquarters but in London, where he could function more independently. He hired a staff of "bloodthirsty piranhas" from Wall Street who knew how to push boundaries, as Enrich's tale tells. Among them was Bill Broeksmit, a risk management genius who subsequently killed himself as regulators were moving in on the bank and whose death is the mystery Enrich uses to frame the story. Mitchell died early in a plane crash, but the machinery he built kept chugging along. Enrich tells the story of its rise and fall in the careful style of a good newspaper reporter (he is an editor at The New York Times) but allows the complicated material to unfold like a good novel. Over time, he writes, Deutsche Bank became less German and more global, so much so that the bank had to post a sign in its London lobby explaining how to say "Deutsche." Too many of the American traders were pronouncing it "douche bank." With the piranhas in charge, Deutsche Bank eventually became the biggest bank in the world, with 90,000 employees and some $2 trillion in assets — almost the size of the German economy, Enrich notes. Despite that, it was a clumsily managed place. The bank's antiquated computer system made it difficult for senior management to monitor London's activities, even if they'd wanted to — and it's not clear they did. Management tended to look the other way when employees broke the rules, even when they did business with dictators like Russian President Vladimir Putin and their friends. "Even by the amoral standards of Wall Street, Deutsche exhibited a jarring lack of interest in its clients' reputations," Enrich writes. Just how disconnected the bank became can be seen in its ongoing relationship with a then New York real estate developer named Donald Trump, whose multiple bankruptcies had made him a pariah in the banking world. One part of Deutsche Bank turned down Trump's request for a loan. But the private banking division, which catered to the rich and famous, arranged the loan anyway — and then, when Trump stopped making payments, arranged another one. Trump's murky relationship with Deutsche Bank is still under congressional investigation, so Enrich's story is necessarily incomplete. Still, the book has enough detail to make its case that Deutsche Bank was more than just one more rogue bank; it is a cautionary tale of what happens when a bank pursues profits at any cost, without being weighed down by pesky moral scruples.
Losing Sleep Over The Quest For A Perfect Night's Rest,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/18/805291279/losing-sleep-over-the-quest-for-a-perfect-nights-rest,February 18, 2020,

 Sleep trackers have become increasingly popular, but for some people, perfecting their sleep score becomes an end unto itself. If you're having a hard time falling asleep, that sleep tracker on your wrist might be to blame. And there's a name for this new kind of insomnia of the digital age: orthosomnia. It's "when you just really become fixated on having this perfect sleep via tracker," said Seema Khosla, medical director at the North Dakota Center for Sleep. "And then you start worrying about it, and you wind up giving yourself insomnia." Sleep trackers have become increasingly popular. They come in the form of watches, wristbands, rings and even mattresses. The gadgets measure how you breathe, how fast your heart is beating, how much you're tossing and turning. They crunch that data to produce a sleep score, usually through a smartphone app. But in an irony of our digital lifestyles, for some people, perfecting that sleep score becomes an end unto itself — so much so that they can lose sleep over it. Khosla sees this is her own practice as a sleep doctor. Stressed-out patients complain they are aiming for a sleep score of 100 but are getting only 80. It keeps them up at night. She has a simple solution. "I'll ask them just to put their tracker away for a couple of weeks. And honestly, sometimes you can just see the relief on their faces," she said. Kathrin Hamm experienced this problem firsthand. She was traveling around the world as an economist for the World Bank, and getting good sleep was a priority. "Basically, if I wasn't on a plane, I was on the road kind of around in Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan," she said. "I've never been a good sleeper. ... But during that time, I really had developed insomnia and some serious sleep issues." Tracking her sleep made things worse. "I actually realized that I'm even more stressed out to see kind of like in writing ... that I'm not sleeping well," she said. "Instead of addressing the root cause, I was more concerned about [continuing] measuring, measuring." Hamm tried other solutions, including noise machines, expensive pillows and mattresses. But nothing worked. Finally, she tried a weighted blanket. These heavy covers are usually filled with plastic or glass beads. They're used in therapy to help kids with autism and sensory problems. Fans like Hamm say the weight lifts anxiety, allowing them to relax. "I tried one of these on a Saturday afternoon to nap with it for a short time. And I woke up four hours later," Hamm said. Her problem is one that millions of people can relate to. A third of Americans say they don't get the recommended seven hours of sleep a night, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's fueling a boom in products promising to help people improve their sleep. The sleep market is worth tens of billions of dollars, from weighted blankets to tech gadgets like trackers and meditation headbands. Not getting enough rest is unhealthy. It increases the risk of conditions from depression to heart disease. Sleep doctors blame technology in part for bad sleep habits — particularly the smartphones that keep us constantly connected and stimulated. Khosla calls this problem "social jet lag." Like jet lag from travel, social jet lag occurs when we interrupt our bodies' internal clocks. "We are just on our phones too long," Khosla said. "We are not getting enough sleep or not prioritizing sleep or staying up late because of work demands or parenting or whatever demand." Some new sleep products are trying to help people break away from those distractions. A company called Hatch sells a combination reading light and noise machine. At bedtime, it starts with a guided meditation, plays white noise while you're sleeping and wakes you up with a simulated sunrise and bird song. Many of those functions can be found through smartphone apps. But Hatch co-founder Ann Crady Weiss says the intention is to help people leave their phone outside their bedroom. "The reason we have our phones by our bedside is because they're super-helpful. Yeah, I can listen to my meditation [app]. I can, you know, use it as an alarm," she acknowledged. "The problem is, at 4 a.m., when you wake up [and] go to put that meditation back on, Twitter is calling your name and Instagram. And that's really, really harmful for our sleep." As for Hamm, the World Bank economist who couldn't get to sleep? Weighted blankets helped her so much that she quit her job and started her own company, Bearaby, selling them. There's no technology involved.

Listen to the episode at the top of the page, or find it here. New cars these days have better safety features and more tech gizmos than models from a decade ago. And let's face it, trading in a beat-up clunker with grimy seats is an enticing idea. But many Americans make big mistakes buying cars. Take new car purchases with a trade-in. A third of buyers roll over an average of $5,000 in debt from their last car into their new loan. They're paying for a car they don't drive anymore. Ouch! That is not a winning personal finance strategy. But don't worry — NPR's Life Kit is here to help. Here's how to buy a car without getting over your head in debt or paying more than you have to. 1. Get preapproved for a loan before you set foot in a dealer's lot. "The single best advice I can give to people is to get preapproved for a car loan from your bank, a credit union or an online lender," says Philip Reed. He's an automotive expert who writes a column for the personal finance site NerdWallet. He also worked undercover at an auto dealership to learn the secrets of the business when he worked for the car-buying site Edmunds.com. So Reed is going to pull back the curtain on the car-buying game. For one thing, he says, getting a loan from a lender outside the car dealership prompts buyers to think about a crucial question: "How much car can I afford? You want to do that before a salesperson has you falling in love with the limited model with the sunroof and leather seats." Reed says getting preapproved also reveals any problems with your credit. So before you start car shopping, you might want to build up your credit score or get erroneous information off your credit report. And shop around for the best interest rate. "People are being charged more for interest rates than they should be based upon their creditworthiness," says John Van Alst, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center. Van Alst says many people don't realize it, but the dealership is allowed to jack up the rate it offers you above what you actually qualify for. With your credit score "you might qualify for an interest rate of 6%," says Van Alst, but the dealership might not tell you that and offer you a 9% rate.  If you take that bad deal, you could pay thousands of dollars more in interest. Van Alst says the dealership and its finance company, "they'll split that extra money." Reed says having that preapproval can be a valuable card to have in your hand to help you negotiate a better rate.  "The preapproval will act as a bargaining chip," he says. "If you're preapproved at 4.5%, the dealer says, 'Hey, you know, I can get you 3.5. Would you be interested?' And it's a good idea to take it, but make sure all of the terms and conditions, meaning the down payment and the length of the loan, remain the same." 2. Test drive, test drive, test drive.   These days many of us like to research things we buy online. And that's good. But you also need to get your hands off the laptop or smartphone and onto some steering wheels or you'll waste a lot of time researching vehicles that you won't like in the end. Dianne Whitmire sells cars at a Toyota dealership near Los Angeles. She says she constantly sees people who spend hours and hours online researching a car, finding the best price, all the other information. They call her 10 times. But when they finally show up to drive the car, they say, "I didn't realize this seat was this way. This is not the model I want." Whitmire says you need to be a bit more old school about things and actually drive a bunch of cars. "I've been doing this for 40 years," she says. "It used to be that people would go to a dealership and drive around and figure out what car they actually wanted, what their choices were."  She suggests driving cars that are within your budget so you aren't seduced by what you can't afford. This means you want to find salespeople who are OK showing you a bunch of cars and not being too pushy or trying to upsell you into a pricier model. "That person who says, 'What about right now, that car right out there right now? What would it take?'" — repeatedly trying to sell you a car that very day — she says that's probably a sign you've got the wrong salesperson.  One thing you can do in that situation is just tell the salesperson, "Look, I'm not ready to buy a car today. I'm test-driving a few cars, I'm narrowing it down. If you're not comfortable with that maybe there's another salesperson here who can show me a car." 3. Start with the price of the car.  If you're buying a car at a dealership, focus on one thing at a time. And don't tell the salespeople too much. Remember, this is a kind of game. If you're playing cards, you don't hold them up and say, "Hey, everybody, look — I have a pair of queens," right? So at the dealership, Reed and Van Alst both say, the first step is to start with the price of the vehicle you are buying.  The salesperson at the dealership will often want to know if you're planning to trade in another car and whether you're also looking to get a loan through the dealership. Reed says don't answer those questions! That makes the game too complicated, and you're playing against pros.  If you negotiate a really good purchase price on the car, they might jack up the interest rate to make extra money or lowball you on your trade-in. They can juggle all those factors in their head at once. You don't want to. Keep it simple. One thing at a time. Once you settle on a price, then you can talk about a trade-in if you have one. But Reed and Van Alst say to do your homework there, too. A little research online can tell you what your trade is worth in ballpark terms.  Reed suggests looking at the free pricing guides at Edmunds.com, Kelley Blue Book and NADA. On Autotrader, you can also see what people in your area are asking for your car model. And, he says, "You can get an actual offer from Carvana.com and also by taking the car to a CarMax, where they will write you a check on the spot." He and Van Alst say don't be afraid to walk away or buy the car at a good price without the trade-in if you feel the dealership is lowballing you on your old car. You have plenty of other good options these days. 4. Beware of seven-year car loans. A third of new car loans are now longer than six years. And that's "a really dangerous trend," says Reed. We have a whole story about why that's the case. In short, a seven-year loan will mean lower monthly payments than a five-year loan. But it will also mean paying a lot more money in interest.  As with other types of loans, you pay a lot more interest than principal in the early years, so you're paying off what you actually owe much more slowly in a seven-year loan. "There's so much interest front-loaded in that," says Whitmire. Seven-year car loans are financially dangerous because cars depreciate in value the moment you drive off the lot. "You're waging this battle against depreciation because basically you're paying off a loan while the car drops in value," says Reed. One big risk is that you might need to sell the car well before seven years. You might lose your job, or you have a kid, or a third kid and need a minivan. When you go to sell that car on a seven-year loan, you're likely going to find out that you owe thousands of dollars more than the car is actually worth.  NPR talked to one car buyer who rolled over $17,000 into his next car because he was so upside down on the vehicle — in other words, he owed that much more on the loan than the car was actually worth. So a seven-year car loan: bad idea.  "If a friend asked me," says Whitmire, "I'd say I wouldn't do it." A lot of people could apparently use this advice. According to industry data, 32% of new car buyers with a trade-in are rolling over about $5,000 in negative equity into their next loan when they buy a new car.  A better way to go, Reed says, is a five-year loan for a new car, and "with a used car you should really finance it for only three years, which is 36 months." One reason that makes sense, he says, is that if your used car breaks down and isn't worth fixing — say the transmission totally goes — you're more likely to have paid off the loan by that time. Reed says a five-year loan makes sense for new cars because "that's been the traditional way — it's kind of a sweet spot. The payments aren't too high. You know the car will still be in good condition. There will still be value in the car at the end of the five years." 5. Don't buy any add-ons at the dealership. If you've bought a car, you know how this works. You've been at the dealership for hours, you're tired, you've settled on a price, you've haggled over the trade-in — then you get handed off to the finance manager. "You're led to this back office. They'll often refer to it as the box," says Van Alst. This is where the dealership will try to sell you extended warranties, tire protection plans, paint protection plans, something called gap insurance. Dealerships make a lot of money on this stuff. And Van Alst says it's often very overpriced and most people have no idea how to figure out a fair price. "Is this add-on, you know, being marked up 300%? You don't really know any of that," Van Alst says. He and Reed say a good strategy, especially with a new car, is to just say no — to everything. He says especially with longer-term loans, there's more wiggle room for dealers to try to sell you the extras. The finance person might try to tell you, "It's only a little more money per month." But that money adds up. "Concerning the extended factory warranty, you can always buy it later," says Reed. "So if you're buying a new car, you can buy it in three years from now, just before it goes out of warranty." At that point, if you want the extended warranty, he says, you should call several dealerships and ask for the best price each can offer.  That way, he says, you're not rolling the cost into your car loan and paying interest on a service you wouldn't even use for three years because you're still covered by the new car's warranty. Gap insurance promises to cover any gap between the purchase price of replacing your almost-new car with a brand-new car if your regular insurance doesn't pay for full replacement if your car gets totaled. Van Alst says gap insurance is often overpriced and is fundamentally problematic. If you still want the product, it's best to obtain it through your regular insurance company, not the dealer. 6. Don't buy too much car. And consider a used car to save a lot of money. "The golden rule is that all of your car expenses should really be no more than 20% of your take-home pay," says Reed. And he says that that's total car expenses, including insurance, gas and repairs. "So the car payment itself should be between 10 and 15%." And if a new car with a five-year loan doesn't fit into your budget, you might decide you don't really need a brand-new car. "We're actually living in a golden age of used cars," says Reed. "I mean, the reliability of used cars is remarkable these days." He says there is an endless river of cars coming off three-year leases that are in very good shape. And even cars that are older than that are definitely worth considering.  "You know, people are buying good used cars at a hundred-thousand miles and driving them for another hundred-thousand miles," says Reed. "So I'm a big fan of buying a used car as a way to save money." He acknowledges that which car you buy matters. It's a good idea to read reviews and ratings about which brands and models are more or less likely to run into costly repair problems down the road. He says some European cars are famously expensive to maintain. NPR has a personal finance Facebook group called Your Money and Your Life. And we asked group members about car buying. Many said they were shocked by how much money some other people in the group said they were spending on cars.  Patricia and Dean Raeker from Minneapolis wrote, "40 years of owning vehicles and our total transportation purchases don't even add up to the cost of one of the financed ones these folks are talking about." Dean is a freelance AV technician, and Patricia is a flight attendant. They say, "our nicest, newest purchase was a 2004 Honda Accord for $2,400, bought last year, that with regular maintenance could likely last another 100,000+ miles." And they say they "can't understand those who insist on driving their retirement funds away." Even if you buy a slightly newer used car than the Raekers', the couple raises a great point. What else could you be spending that car payment money on? And if you can cut in half what you might otherwise spend, that's a lot of extra money for your retirement account, your kids' college fund or whatever else you'd rather be doing with that money.

Uber Whistleblower Takes On Silicon Valley, Armed With Stoic Philosophy,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/18/804501264/uber-whistleblower-takes-on-silicon-valley-armed-with-stoic-philosophy,February 18, 2020, My Journey to Silicon Valley and Fight for Justice at Uber by Susan Fowler Hardcover, 260 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? In 2017, Susan Fowler published a blog post that shook Silicon Valley. Her matter-of-fact account of sexism, sexual harassment and "unrelenting chaos" on Uber's software teams prompted a reckoning that brought down CEO Travis Kalanick. It's easy to focus on what happened to Fowler. Her manager messaging her about sex on her very first day. A different manager sneakily changing her good performance review to a bad one, to block her from moving to a less-dysfunctional unit. The absurd episode with the leather jackets. But in her new memoir, Whistleblower: My Journey to Silicon Valley and Fight for Justice at Uber, Fowler makes a dedicated plea for you to focus, instead, on what she did about it. Again and again throughout the book, she says she wants to be the hero of her story — not the victim. Or, to use an Isaiah Berlin quote she's fond of, "a subject, not an object." The memoir does provide more eyebrow-raising details about just how hostile and chaotic Uber's workplace was. But Fowler is much more interested in unpacking how — and why — she responded by going public. Her upbringing was unusual: She grew up in a large, impoverished, deeply religious family in rural Arizona and was homeschooled before becoming wholly self-taught. She calls it a wonderful childhood, full of books and music and desert adventures, but it certainly wasn't easy. As a child, she describes feeding venomous spiders to help support the family (yes, seriously), and as a teenager the lack of a structured education brought her to tears repeatedly. Fowler spends little time on her youth, which some readers may find disappointing, and aside from a partial biography of her father, she never fleshes out her siblings or parents into characters. She focuses more on college, where, in addition to starting her lifelong study of philosophy, she fell in love with physics, only to discover she was woefully unqualified for the math courses. Over intense opposition from administrators, Fowler says, she took them anyway — and, after some rocky early classes, thrived. She seemed on track for a Ph.D. in physics until what she describes as a painful and rather bizarre experience of mistreatment — one that clearly shaped her reaction to harassment at Uber. Fowler says multiple professors instructed her to set aside her research work and instead dedicate herself to monitoring and supporting another student who had threatened suicide. The administration wouldn't help her, and she faced retribution for her complaints, she says. (NPR has reached out to the university for comment.) Lawyers advised that going to court would be more misery than it was worth, so she walked away from physics. Fowler had dreamed of being an architect, then a violinist, then a philosopher or a physicist. She had never dreamed of being a software engineer. But she needed to do something, and her physics work had involved coding, so, software engineering it was. And yes, if you're keeping track at home, this means Silicon Valley was a backup career choice. At her first tech job, she writes, she was paid significantly less than her male co-workers. At the second, she describes an openly misogynistic boss. She hoped making the switch to Uber — a large, established company with an HR department — would pay off in better working conditions. Alas, we all know how that turned out. Fowler's occasionally eye-popping account of life at Uber ends with her making the leap to another job and reflecting seriously on her ethical obligations before deciding to speak out. In the anxious months after she went public with her story, she says she was followed and investigated by Uber goons. But the story does not end with Uber's triumphant revenge: Fowler emphasizes that she's thriving in every way possible. This memoir is a bit of a how-to book, too, with some take-home lessons for anyone discouraged by a hostile workplace. Document everything, Fowler emphasizes: Screenshots; copies; detailed notes. Complain through the proper channels, even if you know they won't work, and document your complaint. If it happens again, complain again. Do your job very well throughout (and document that, too). Know your rights. If they say you're the only one with a complaint, check if that's true. And seriously, document everything.  If none of that works? Consider what you owe the world. Read some philosophy. Or, in Fowler's case, read a lot of philosophy — especially the Stoics. Then decide what to do with your mountain of documentation. And while solving Uber's management issues is not Fowler's concern, she does have a word of caution for the company and its peers. Silicon Valley has caught on to the fact that it has a diversity problem. Large companies are vowing to do more to recruit women and underrepresented minorities. But Fowler bluntly says that's no solution. "Uber didn't just need more women engineers, or more employees of color," she writes. "It needed to stop breaking the law .... It didn't matter how many black engineers we hired, if they were discriminated against; it didn't matter how many women we put into positions of power, if those women perpetrated or enabled the illegal behavior."

 Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced Monday he would spend $10 billion of his own fortune to launch a global initiative to fight climate change. He is photographed here in front of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced Monday he is committing $10 billion to fight climate change, which he calls "the biggest threat to our planet." Bezos says the funds will go toward the creation of the Bezos Earth Fund.  "This global initiative will fund scientists, activists, NGOs — any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world," he writes in an Instagram post. "I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet."  Today, I’m thrilled to announce I am launching the Bezos Earth Fund.⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet. I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share. This global initiative will fund scientists, activists, NGOs — any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world. We can save Earth. It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals. ⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ I’m committing $10 billion to start and will begin issuing grants this summer.

But some Amazon workers, deeply critical of their employer's own environmental record, say it is Amazon itself that has been complicit in the climate crisis and must change its ways.  "We applaud Jeff Bezos' philanthropy, but one hand cannot give what the other is taking away," Amazon Employees For Climate Justice said in a statement in response to the pledge.  As employees, here is our statement to Jeff Bezos' Earth Fund announcement (as an image): pic.twitter.com/opgcCpa67D "When is Amazon going to stop helping oil & gas companies ravage Earth with still more oil and gas wells? When is Amazon going to stop funding climate-denying think tanks like the Competitive Enterprise Institute and climate-delaying policy? When will Amazon take responsibility for the lungs of children near its warehouses by moving from diesel to all-electric trucking?" In April, thousands of Amazon workers signed an open letter to Bezos and Amazon's board of directors, calling on them to end contracts with oil and gas companies, halt donations to climate change-denying lawmakers and setting measurable goals.  Around 1,700 workers joined a global climate walkout on Sept. 20. In a statement, they said "as employees at one of the largest and most powerful companies in the world, our role in facing the climate crisis is to ensure our company is leading on climate, not following." A day before the walkout, Amazon addressed the demands, announcing its Climate Pledge, committing to use 100% renewable energy by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2040.  Part of its pledge involves the purchase of 100,000 emissions-free electric vehicles from Rivian, a Michigan-based company in which it is investing hundreds of millions of dollars.  The e-commerce behemoth ships billions of items worldwide, relying on fossil fuels to power its fleet of planes and trucks.  Bezos is the richest person in the world, according to Forbes, which puts his net worth at $126.9 billion. The world's second wealthiest person, Bill Gates, who Forbes says trails Bezos by $14.5 billion, is also making the climate crisis a philanthropic priority.

 Disposable vapes may be hotter than Juul among kids, according to researcher Bonnie Halpern-Felsher. She received a bag of vape pens recently confiscated by a high school principal in northern California, with flavors like Banana Ice and Cool Mint. Efforts to stem the tide of teen vaping seem to be a step behind the market. By the time Juul pulled most of its flavored pods from the market in October of 2019, many teens had already moved on to an array of newer, disposable vape products. "Juul is almost old school ... It's no longer the teen favorite," says Meredith Berkman, co-founder of the advocacy group PAVE, Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes. "Among the disposables [that] are most popular, there's Puff Bar, there's Stig, there's Viigo," Berkman says. They're designed for one-time use. Then, they're tossed, she explains. "These have just flooded the market," Berkman says. These products are flourishing despite the Trump administration's partial ban on flavored e-cigarettes, announced in January and in effect as of Feb 5. The enforcement guidance issued by Food and Drug Administration was aimed at stopping young people from vaping. It focused enforcement on flavored cartridges, like Juul's popular products.  But it left open some "loopholes," says Matt Myers of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. "It won't take the kids and it hasn't taken the kids any time to make a switch [to newer products]." At any time, the FDA could crack down on the new disposables. The agency has enforcement discretion to take action and in the guidance the agency specified it could take action on any e-cigarette product that's "targeted to minors." The industry has been very creative at getting new products on the market quickly, despite regulators' efforts to curb teen use, says Cristine Delnevo, who directs the Center for Tobacco Studies at Rutgers University. "It's a bit of a game of whack-a-mole, so when policies are aimed at one product, another product pops-up to fill the void," Delnevo says. Delnevo and her collaborators have documented some of the rapid changes in disposable vaping products in a new paper published recently in the journal Tobacco Control. "There are so many of these products," she says. She and her coauthors write that they heard anecdotally last September about a new vaping product, "a disposable 'pod-mod' closely resembling JUUL" that was popular among college students. Combing through threads on Reddit, they found mention of a bunch of brands of disposable "pod-mods" — including Posh, Eon Stik and Mr. Vapor — which began to appear in the spring of 2019. "Comments focused on tasting similar to JUUL flavors, lasting longer than a JUUL pod and having a good 'hit' like a JUUL," they wrote. They also documented advertising for two brands of disposable products in a convenience store near Rutgers. 
                The Puff Bar, 3.75 inches long, comes in a range of sweet and fruity flavors, like Pink Lemonade. Disposable flavored vapes like this are growing popular among teens.

 Some of the most popular new products, such as Puff Bar, come in an array of appealing flavors — similar to what Juul used to sell, says Myers of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. "This one is pink lemonade," Myers says as he shows me a Puff Bar. It's a vape pen that looks like an elongated thumb drive. "And when you inhale it, it has a sweet, sugary flavor," says Myers. These flavors cut the harshness of the tobacco. "Young people are inhaling more deeply and getting higher levels of nicotine in their lungs than they would have with a cigarette." (NPR reached out to the makers of Puff Bar, via an email listed on the product packaging, to ask about marketing and sales of the product. The company did not respond.) "The Puff Bar is an extremely popular product," says Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, a developmental psychologist at Stanford University. One bar has about 300 puffs and can contain about as much nicotine as two or three packs of cigarettes. "That's a lot of nicotine," she says. And, research shows nicotine is addictive and harmful to adolescents' developing brains. She says because these products are so new, and the landscape changes quickly, it's difficult to know how many teens are using them and similar disposable products. But she received a bag of confiscated vape sticks and pens that a high school principal in northern California collected recently and shared with her. "When I laid them out, the majority of them are disposable products," Halpern-Felsher says. "They come in lots of flavors, colors, [they're] very attractive to youth and that's what we're seeing them using the most right now." 1) Don't confront. Start with a softer approach "We know that teens don't respond well to just being told about harms or scare tactics," says Halpern-Felsher. She says if you start a conversation by saying "Johnny, you're not vaping, right?" you're not likely to get far. Instead, start by telling your teen what you've learned about vaping — and why it concerns you. Say something like: "I've learned how much nicotine is in the products, what have you heard?" Engage them in a conversation to share information. Then, through that conversation, "it [may] come out whether or not the adolescent is using," she says. "If you find out they're using — tell them you'd like to get them help." 2) Know what products are still available "Before you sit down with your kid, read up on the latest products. Know what they look like and know what the lingo is, " advises PAVE's Berkman. PAVE offers a toolkit for parents. In addition to disposable vape sticks, there are refillable cartridges and flavored nicotine liquids, often called "e-liquids" available. "Right now, you can buy e-liquids on-line, often on websites that are not really age-protected," Matt Myers says. "And increasingly [they're available] in convenience stores and gas stations," he adds. He says the product manufacturers "have figured out how to deliver more nicotine to young people than the cigarette manufacturers ever did," so they can be highly addictive. "Sit down with your young people to make sure they understand that these products are not safe and that they run a serious risk of an addiction," Myers says. 3) Find help online There are a number of online, digital QUIT programs. For instance, My Life My Quit is available in more than a dozen states. The Truth Initiative offers a text-based quitting program that young people can sign up for by texting DITCHJUUL to 88709. For more information, parents and educators can search an online resource from the Truth Initiative of research and reports about emerging tobacco products. And Halpern-Felsher and a team of collaborators have created a tobacco-prevention toolkit.

 Trash from an informal dump in far northern Pakistan is frequently incinerated, sending up plumes of foul-smelling smoke right near a glacial lake frequented by tourists. The residents of Murtazabad, a village in the highlands of Pakistan, are welcoming of strangers. On a recent day, they proffered passing visitors a yak meat porridge they had made for a religious celebration. They indulgently smiled as a horde of Thai tourists raced into one of their orchards and posed with piles of red and yellow apples. But some days, their patience wears thin. And those days are happening more often as this once-remote province becomes a wildly popular destination not only for foreign tourists posing in their apple orchards, but also for Pakistanis who come from the plains below.

"Most tourists are wonderful, but some are just so dirty. They come here to see our beautiful region, and they leave their trash behind," says Benazir Jamal, a 25-year-old gym teacher, who said her village organized a committee to clean up after tourists. "Not all fingers of the hand are the same," Jamal said, referring to Pakistanis visiting the area. Pointed opinions about Pakistani tourists can be heard across the far northern territory of Gilgit-Baltistan, an otherworldly place of snow-capped peaks, glaciers, rivers and orchards. It spotlights the frictions between Pakistan's multiple ethnic and religious groups, and the challenges facing the country as it tries to lure more visitors. Signs are pasted throughout residential areas forbidding photography and entrance to tourists. Other signs urge them, in English and Urdu, to pick up their trash. "The problem is basically, unfortunately, and I am sorry to say this, especially our Pakistani tourists. They have not right manners," says Aqeela Bano, who heads the Ciqam Project, a network of organizations run by women, including a carpentry workshop and a café and hotel. 
                Women work in a carpentry workshop run by the aid group Ciqam. The group trains and employs 25 women, in part because of a building boom in far northern Pakistan, triggered by a rush of domestic tourism. They make door frames, window frames and furniture.

 Women work in a carpentry workshop run by the aid group Ciqam. The group trains and employs 25 women, in part because of a building boom in far northern Pakistan, triggered by a rush of domestic tourism. They make door frames, window frames and furniture. Tensions emerged after domestic tourists nearly outnumbered the territory's 1.5 million locals over the past two summers, according to Usman Ahmed, commissioner of the Gilgit division, one of the area's highest-ranking officials. There were no official figures for this past summer, but it was even busier, officials said. "We were not ready for that," Ahmed says. He noted that a decade ago, just over 50,000 domestic tourists visited.

 Tourists pose for photos on a medieval fort near the town of Karimabad in the highlands of Pakistan. Only one town in the territory has a sewage system. So more visitors means more human waste washes into the tributaries that feed the Indus River, Pakistan's main water source. The area does not have regular trash collection, so the extra garbage generated by tourists was dumped into the river or incinerated at an informal dump near a glacial lake — frequented by the same tourists. On a recent day, crows picked through smoldering trash that emitted foul fumes. To accommodate tourists, there is a construction boom. Enormous hotels now loom over some villages. Concrete flophouses flash neon signs. Ahmed is worried, he says, because the construction industry is loosely regulated. "We don't want to become a concrete jungle," he says. Domestic tourists began pouring in about six years ago, Ahmed says. The sudden surge is owed to a convergence of factors: sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shiites in far northern Pakistan was quelled by authorities, making the road safe for visitors. The road itself — a highway of hairpin turns — was improved, making it easier to drive up. And tales of the area's beauty spread through word of mouth and social media, according to both tourists and officials.

 Boat rides on the Attabad glacial lake, which is several miles long, is a popular tourist activity in far northern Pakistan. The tourists include Mohammad Afzal and his wife, Nazira, from the southern city of Larkana, who said they had brought their extended family of 22 people for a weeklong stay in the region. "We saw a video and were like, 'Let's go!' " Nazira says, as they passed around hot mugs of chai on a freezing day. "We went to the China border, and the kids saw snow. They were so excited," she says.

 A child waves to tourists from a minivan in a small town in far northern Pakistan. Some tourists' behavior is unwelcome in the area. Nazira, like many Pakistani tourists interviewed, says she was horrified to hear that locals found them to be unclean. "We throw our trash in the bin," she insists. But at the next table, another group of Pakistani tourists left their pizza boxes and plastic cups of tea on a table, ignoring the large trash can nearby. Regardless of how the majority of Pakistani tourists behave, clearly there are problems. Some of the city's bazaars are pasted with signs pleading with tourists to use trash cans and to not take photos. Residents said that during the summer, visiting Pakistani men snapped photos of local women without their permission and shared them online. 
                Signs abound through heavily-visited tourist areas in far northern Pakistan urging tourists to not take photos, to clean up their trash and to not enter residential areas.

 Signs abound through heavily-visited tourist areas in far northern Pakistan urging tourists to not take photos, to clean up their trash and to not enter residential areas. "We didn't put [these warning signs] up when it was just foreign tourists," says Nazir Ali, who guards a mosque. "But when domestic tourists came, they misused the pictures. A lot of women weren't comfortable. They were scared. They don't know how the picture will be used." Ali says the issue really emerged when residents found images of local women on social media with commentary that suggested they were not honorable. Women in far northern Pakistan don't always cover their hair, they have a tradition of working in public as farmers, shopkeepers and shepherds, and their girls play sports in public — a stark contrast to the far more conservative plains below and even to other communities in the mountains. The patron of a tiny restaurant, Lal Shehzadi, 38, acknowledged cultural tensions with domestic tourists. She says some of them have asked if her husband was dead, and if not, why she worked, because it was so unusual in the plains. As she served local delicacies like savory apricot soup, yak curry, salty tea and mutton pies, Shehzadi says she often retorted: "Why do you cover your women?"

 Lal Shehzadi flattens out dough to make a mutton pie in her small restaurant in the town of Karimabad. Tourists from more conservative parts of Pakistan wonder why she works. Other residents noted the upside to domestic tourism. Bano of the Ciqam Project said the influx has allowed the network to employ 25 female carpenters to supply window frames, doors and wooden designs for new buildings. Musician Zia Ul Karim, 25, says the tourists helped revive interest in folkloric music by requesting it to be performed at local shows. He talks of "melodies which are almost dying" because of the "lack of importance given to them by people." Speaking after a performance, he said sometimes it takes a stranger to remind people of what they should hold dear. In a territory once nearly entirely reliant on farming, Mubaraka, 13, listed the ways tourism has bettered the lives of residents in their poor, one-road village, where children ran around in flip-flops in heavy-jacket weather. Tourists bought their farm produce. Shops sold more goods. There was work in the industry. But domestic tourists also upset her, she said. She gestured to a meadow where goats graze, overlooking pointy, snowy peaks. A few weeks ago, she cleaned it up after tourists. Officials said they were also trying to lure high-dollar foreign visitors — with some success, like the Thai tourists who tumbled into that apple orchard in Murtazabad. Piayooan Yuentiakul, 55, from Bangkok, said Pakistan was a "top of the bucket list" among his friends because of the stunning red and yellow fall colors.

 Thai tourists pose in piles of picked apples in an orchard in the village of Murtazabad. For some, visiting the area was on their "bucket list." To attract more visitors from other Asian countries, authorities advertise the area's ancient Buddhist heritage. To lure adventure tourists, they host activities like a desert car rally, yak polo and one of the world's highest-altitude bike races, as well as offer the chance to climb some of the world's tallest mountains. Figures given by Ahmed, the commissioner, suggested a slow but steady climb of foreign tourists to Murtazabad, reaching just over 10,000 last year — a tiny proportion of the 1.2 million foreign tourists who arrived in Pakistan in total, according to the country's 2018 Travel & Tourism Economic Impact report.

 Tourists loiter about the Khunjrab Pass — the icy, snowy border crossing between Pakistan and China. Foreign tourists say they are delighted by Pakistan, like German visitor Carsten Korfmacher. He had been hiking on glaciers and trekking through base camps of some of the world's tallest mountains. The best part was "people are so friendly," he says. Twice, he said, he had been invited to attend local weddings. "I wish people were so friendly in my country," he says. Nothing though, could beat the enthusiasm of Daniel Porter, from Britain, who just finished a boat ride on a glacial lake. Smoothing back his dreadlocks, Porter said people kept inviting him to stay with them. "Everyone just smiles," he says. "Everyone wants to help you." Locals agree. As long as you pick up your own trash. Nazim Ullah Baig contributed to this report.

 The Chinese technology firm Huawei is facing a raft of U.S. federal charges, including racketeering conspiracy. Updated 6:50 a.m. ET Friday Federal prosecutors have added new charges against Chinese telecom giant Huawei, its U.S. subsidiaries and its chief financial officer, including accusing it of racketeering and conspiracy to steal trade secrets from U.S.-based companies. The company already faced a long list of criminal accusations in the case, which was first filed in August 2018, including bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Prosecutors filed the expanded indictment in federal court in Brooklyn on Thursday. In a statement provided to NPR by Huawei, the company said the charges are "an attempt to irrevocably damage Huawei's reputation and its business for reasons related to competition rather than law enforcement... The government will not prevail on its charges, which we will prove to be both unfounded and unfair." "The Trump administration has repeatedly made clear it has national security concerns about Huawei, including economic espionage," NPR's Ryan Lucas reported. Recently, Trump tried to convince the U.K. not to contract with Huawei to provide equipment to build a 5G network, but British leaders did so anyway. Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Mark Warner, D-Va., said in a joint statement that the indictment "paints a damning portrait of an illegitimate organization that lacks any regard for the law." Huawei is also accused of doing business in countries subject to U.S. sanctions such as North Korea and Iran. Prosecutors accuse Huawei of helping Iran's government "by installing surveillance equipment, including surveillance equipment used to monitor, identify and detain protesters during the anti-government demonstrations of 2009 in Tehran, Iran." They say that for decades, Huawei has worked to "misappropriate intellectual property, including from six U.S. technology companies, in an effort to grow and operate Huawei's business." Huawei allegedly pushed its employees to bring in confidential information from competitors, even offering bonuses for the "most valuable stolen information," according to the indictment. The 56-page indictment is rife with examples of Huawei scheming to obtain trade secrets from U.S. companies. They also allegedly attempted to recruit employees from rival companies or would use proxies such as professors working at research institutions to access intellectual property. For example, starting in 2000 the defendants allegedly took source code and user manuals for Internet routers from an unnamed northern California-based tech company, and incorporated it into its own routers. They then allegedly marketed those routers as a lower-cost version of the tech company's devices. During a 2003 lawsuit, Huawei allegedly claimed that it had removed the source code from the routers and recalled them, but also erased the memories of the recalled devices and sent them to China so they could not be used as evidence. In an incident that drew headlines last year, a Huawei employee in 2012 and 2013 allegedly repeatedly tried to steal technical information about a robot from an unnamed wireless network operator, eventually going as far as making off with the robot's arm. The details match those in a separate federal lawsuit in Seattle where the company is accused of targeting T-Mobile. A subsidiary of the firm also allegedly entered into a partnership in 2009 with a New York and California-based company working to improve cellular telephone reception. Despite a nondisclosure agreement, Huawei employees allegedly stole technology. The subsidiary eventually filed a patent that allegedly relied on the other company's intellectual property.
For Rent: Fast Fashion,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/13/805821902/for-rent-fast-fashion,February 13, 2020, Fashion brands like H&M, Zara, and ASOS have created a world where new trends move almost instantly from runway to store shelves to closets around the world. Prices (and often quality) are so low it's almost like the clothes are meant to be worn just a few times, then tossed.  That's one of the many critiques consumers have about fast fashion. But, millennial and Gen Z shoppers are also wary of the harm fast fashion causes to the environment. So, when H&M announced it's planning to start renting clothing in a bid to keep younger, more socially-conscious customers, we tried to find out how the company plans to pull it off.

 A clerk pick an item for a customer order at the Amazon Prime warehouse in New York. Amazon Empire director James Jacoby describes the pace of work within the company's warehouses as "incredibly grueling." Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is now the richest man in the world, with an empire that stretches from Hollywood to Whole Foods — and even into outer space. The new PBS Frontline documentary, Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos, investigates how Bezos transformed Amazon from an online bookseller into a trillion-dollar business that's unprecedented in its size and reach. Director James Jacoby, who worked with fellow filmmaker Anya Bourg on the project, calls the company an "inescapable part of our modern lives." "It's not just how the majority of Americans are shopping online," he says. "It's also these devices in our homes. It's also the facial recognition software that's used by police departments. It's cloud computing for the government and national security establishment." Jacoby notes that Amazon's ubiquity — and the fact that "so much power is pooled into the hands of one company and one man" — raises a host of issues. The company's Echo smart speaker has been known to record — and occasionally listen to — the conversations of unsuspecting homeowners. In 2019, the European Union antitrust arm announced an investigation into Amazon's use of data collected from third-party sellers. "I think that [Atlantic writer] Franklin Foer in the film puts it best, which is like everything that's amazing or awesome about Jeff Bezos and Amazon is also something to be feared about Amazon and Jeff Bezos," Jacoby says. On why, in part, Amazon began as a bookseller [Bezos] recognized very early on the power of data to predict what people would want. James Jacoby Books are easy to ship. ... And [Bezos] also realized that in the online world, there would be an advantage that no single bookstore could hold all of the books in print. ... He also, I think, saw an opportunity to learn about customers through what they read. He recognized very early on the power of data to predict what people would want. So in many ways, you are what you read and you could glean a lot about a customer from what he or she reads. On working conditions in Amazon warehouses  We spoke to dozens of current and former employees in the reporting process. The nature of the work has changed a bit over the years. When Bezos was first building out these fulfillment centers all over the country in order to deliver on the promise of delivering packages quickly, it was almost ad hoc. They were growing so quickly. And there were a lot of complaints at the time about things like heat stress. There wouldn't be the proper air conditioning in these warehouses, and people would be working like crazy to try to meet these quotas to get the packages out. People would be fainting in these warehouses. There'd be injuries. Over time, the warehouses have become much more systematized, in part because of the automation of the warehouses and buying a robot company that helped to automate things. But one thing that hasn't changed in talking to workers — both current and former — is the pace of work is incredibly grueling. You have to make rates. ... The rate essentially measures how quickly you pick and pack items. ... Every single worker we spoke to [talked about how] the rates were really high. They have a way of setting the rates for the whole warehouse — that if you don't make that rate, then you can get a write up. And if you get three write ups, then you can be fired. There's a lot of anxiety in these warehouses about making rates. On a recent hack on Amazon's "Ring" cameras  Ring makes these doorbell cameras, that was their first main device. ... It's a doorbell that has a camera on it. In part, Amazon liked the idea of it, because package theft is a big deal for the company — a lot of people get packages to their door and someone's stealing that package. So now you can watch your front step. Of course, if the camera is watching the front step, it's also watching the public space on the street as well, which is somewhat problematic. So there's now this whole suite of Ring devices and Ring cameras, not just to monitor the outside of your home but also the inside of your home. There was a recent hack of indoor Ring cameras, which was rather frightful. ... There's a little girl in her room and her parents had installed a Ring camera in that room and all of a sudden there's a voice coming from the camera that's basically terrorizing her as she's alone in her room. On how facial recognition software and data collection is in Amazon's hands, and is vulnerable to hacks and bad agents  All of this data, all of these networks — it's all up to Amazon to manage this well. And they say that that's the thing that holds them accountable, keeps them responsible on a daily basis, is that they can't breach customer trust. For a company that's built its brand on building customer trust on delivering for customers, on not breaching their trust, these sorts of hacks, these sorts of problems, are devastating to their image, because it gets customers and citizens concerned about whether we should entrust a company like Amazon with all of this. And, of course, there are safeguards in place. ... some of the larger questions about Amazon are whether there are really any auditing systems, public auditing systems for cases of abuse. James Jacoby But I think some of the larger questions about Amazon are whether there are really any auditing systems, public auditing systems for cases of abuse. ... We're reliant on a private company to police abuse, and there's no way to publicly audit whether they're doing a good job of that. And that's something that we asked Amazon executives about — not just about Ring cameras and Echo devices — but certainly facial recognition software, which is a very powerful tool that they have really encouraged police departments around the country to experiment with. On Sen. Elizabeth Warren's idea of breaking up big tech companies  Essentially, what "break them up" really means is to try to limit the lines of business that Amazon can engage in. So, for instance, Amazon is this platform for online commerce that they themselves are competing on as a store against other stores and retailers. So she has this idea of maybe they shouldn't be competing on a platform that they own, maybe they shouldn't be allowed to be doing that, because they have an unfair advantage. That's in part what break them up means. And so I think it's certainly something that Congress is going to be considering. And I think some of the other candidates have been supportive of that idea of breaking them up. On Bezos' space exploration company Blue Origin  When it comes to Jeff Bezos, he's got two CEOs that are running Amazon and he has stepped away a bit from the company. I mean, he's helping to expand it into India and other places. But as we understand it, his primary goal is to focus on his company Blue Origin. And Blue Origin is his space exploration company. It's his rocket ship company. And essentially it's the fulfillment of something that has been his lifelong goal and plan, which is to, as he puts it, build the infrastructure to go to space and to make it cost-effective for us to figure out what to do in space. ... [Bezos] claims — and I think he's genuine in believing this — that he wants to save planet Earth, and his whole idea is that he wants there to be dynamism and growth. He believes in capitalism. He believes in consumerism. He believes that ... we're going to need to look to the heavens, essentially, to figure out how we can continue to live in a world of dynamism and growth. And that, in Jeff Bezos' mind, means we may need to move heavy industry into space. We may need to mine other planets or planetary objects for their resources, or we may need to actually build space colonies. He is really serious about this.

Can I Date That Co-Worker? What To Consider Before An Office Romance,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/11/804900466/can-i-date-that-co-worker-what-to-consider-before-an-office-romance,February 13, 2020, Credit: Becky Harlan and CJ Riculan/NPR Listen to Life Kit This story is adapted from an episode of Life Kit, NPR's podcast with tools to help you get it together. Listen to the episode at the top of the page, or find it here. Love can be complicated. But mixing love and work is even more so, because it involves your co-workers, your boss and your career.  Plus, the #MeToo movement exposed the prevalence of abuse of power and sexual misconduct in the workplace. This has made both workers and employers more cautious about romance on the job.  In fact, when it comes to love at work, most dating experts are clear about what they recommend: Don't do it. But, of course, people ignore relationship advice all the time. Over half of American workers have had a crush on a co-worker, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. And the workplace is still among the top five places where heterosexual people meet their mates, although it has been overshadowed by online dating and meeting at bars and restaurants. So if you have your eye on a colleague, at least have a plan for how you're going to navigate that before you even dip your toe in precarious waters. Whatever fantasy you might be harboring in your head, it's crucial to be mindful of the potential damage to your job, your employer, your co-workers and your love interest if you pursue that fantasy.  1. Do your due diligence. Many employers have rules about relationships at work, so it's important to find out what your employee handbook says. Employers care about interoffice dating not just for office morale reasons, but because they need to be watchful for things like sexual harassment, discrimination, retaliation and abuse of power. "There may be a variety of things that companies may want to do internally to protect themselves, which is why many companies now have anti-dating policies [or] anti-fraternization policies," says Jess Carbino, a sociologist who studies online dating. Some employers ban interoffice dating altogether. Many prohibit supervisors from dating direct reports. Others say relationships must be disclosed to human resources. Your job may depend on your knowing the rules. Don't wait; know what those rules are. 2. Think through your worst-case scenario. We hate to say plan for the worst, but plan for the worst. Take off your rose-colored glasses and think through the worst-case scenario. This is important because both parties will be accepting risk by getting involved. What if your love interest breaks up with you and starts dating your best friend at work? What if your co-workers complain to human resources that it's affecting their ability to work or get promoted? What if one or both of you end up having to leave the job? "If one potential outcome is that you could lose your job and you could lose your dream, you have to ask if this relationship is really worth it," says Damona Hoffman, a Los Angeles dating coach. Your interoffice romance won't affect just the two of you — it will involve everyone around you and your employer. So understanding what you're putting on the line is key. Credit: Becky Harlan and CJ Riculan/NPR 3. Gauge interest and make it safe to say "no." The #MeToo movement exposed a host of workplace abuses. In response, many workplaces have implemented new rules and guidelines. So if you're going to ask someone out at work, be mindful of potential power dynamics and subtle forms of pressure.  "There is a possibility that you will have to eventually discuss or defend this relationship to a third party, perhaps HR," says Mirande Valbrune, a Miami employment attorney who has written a book about sexual harassment. Read the social cues carefully. If you do ask someone out, emphasize that you are not trying to pressure the person, and make sure the person won't feel like it's awkward to say no. Only ask a co-worker out once. And remember: Anything less than an unqualified "yes" is a "no." There's no gray zone. 4. Be on the same page about whom you're going to tell and what you're going to say. Disclosing a new relationship can be tricky. New workplace couples often hide the fact that they're dating, or at least they think they do, Carbino says. "I think that people who think they have hidden their relationships are probably relatively naive. People are far more observant than they think," she says. So being on the front end of the gossip mill is probably a good idea. Just make sure you consult with your new partner about how and when you're going to handle things. You don't want to catch the person by surprise. Credit: Becky Harlan and CJ Riculan/NPR 5. If things don't work out, be professional. Actually, professionalism is required at all stages. But it's particularly important to remember that post-breakup. You don't want to harass, discriminate or retaliate. That means you should neither seek out nor avoid your ex. Also, keep in mind that your drama should never affect others at work. Hoffman, the dating coach, suggests perspective can help: "You have to step back, see the bigger picture and see where you're headed at that company and how you can refocus your energy to something more constructive than pining over someone in the workplace," she says.  So return to the level of engagement you had with your ex prior to the relationship. Keep focused on work, and don't let your resentments, sadness or anger creep into your workplace communications. If that isn't possible, ask for a transfer or a shift in schedule. And if that still isn't solving the problem, perhaps it's time to chart a new path where you don't encounter your ex every day.

 McClatchy acquired Knight Ridder, the owner of the Miami Herald and dozens of other newspapers, in 2006 but sold off several of those papers. Updated at 10:12 a.m. ET The long slide in the U.S. newspaper industry took another dramatic turn Thursday. McClatchy, which operates the Miami Herald and The Kansas City Star among its 30 newsrooms in 14 states, announced it has filed for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring. Saddled with debt and pension obligations, McClatchy said it will continue to operate as normal during the process. The company said it plans to emerge from bankruptcy in the next few months. "McClatchy remains a strong operating company with an enduring commitment to independent journalism that spans five generations of my family,'' said Kevin McClatchy, the company's chairman and great-great grandson of its founder, James McClatchy.  "This restructuring is a necessary and positive step forward for the business, and the entire Board of Directors has made great efforts to ensure the company is able to operate as usual throughout this process," Kevin McClatchy added in a statement. The company said it's negotiating with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal insurer of private pension plans, and its largest creditor "to address the future of our pension obligations and capital structure." The company said it expects that the PBGC will take over McClatchy's qualified pension plan. McClatchy bought the Knight Ridder newspaper chain — which included the Miami Herald, the San Jose Mercury News and The Philadelphia Inquirer, in 2006. It later sold off several of the Knight Ridder papers. A big investor declared Wednesday that newspapers are "all dying," Bloomberg reported.  Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, said "technological change is destroying the daily newspapers in America. The revenue goes away and the expenses remain and they're all dying." Munger did say that The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal are likely to keep going.  Munger was speaking in Los Angeles at the annual meeting of the Daily Journal Corp., where he is chairman.

 The Greek poet Hesiod, who lived in the 8th century B.C. Steven Medema, author of The Economics Book: From Xenophon to Cryptocurrency, 250 Milestones in the History of Economics, reveals the very first of those milestones: Works and Days, an 8th century B.C. poem by Hesiod.  The poem differed from the famous epics of the era, like The Iliad and The Odyssey, by concerning itself with the proper way to manage a household, or an estate. Hesiod and his brother, Perses, had inherited a large estate from their parents, but Perses had squandered his half and was bribing local officials to let him seize Hesiod's share as well.  Beginning with a classical invocation of the Muses, Works and Days was Hesiod's response to his brother, an attempt to convince Perses that hard work was the proper response to having blown his wealth.  And in writing the poem, Hesiod also introduced three fundamental economic themes that are still relevant to this day: scarcity, shame, and envy. Music by Drop Electric.

 Organziers of the Mobile World Congress had resisted calls to cancel the event, but reversed course after major companies pulled out over coronavirus fears. One of the world's biggest trade shows has been cancelled as mounting concerns over the coronavirus outbreak ripple across the business world. Organizers called off the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, after big-name participants pulled out. The annual conference, scheduled to kick off on Feb. 24, is a marquee event for the city of Barcelona and for the mobile phone industry. It typically attracts more than 100,000 attendees each year who come to check out the latest in smartphone technology. But in recent days, companies from Sony and Intel to Amazon and Facebook said they would stay away because of worries about the safety of their employees. The conference organizer, GSMA, initially resisted calls to cancel. It said it would put in place health precautions including scanning body temperatures, and advised attendees against shaking hands. Still, companies kept pulling out, and on Wednesday, GSMA reversed course. "The global concern regarding the coronavirus outbreak, travel concern and other circumstances, make it impossible for the GSMA to hold the event," the group's CEO, John Hoffman, said in a statement. Other trade shows and business events have also been affected by the outbreak. More than two dozen industry conferences in Asia have been postponed, Reuters reported. Watchmaker Swatch canceled an event in Zurich planned for late February.

 After the messy reporting of the Iowa caucus results, some who build tech for progressive causes say the approach to software development in this space needs rethinking. Democrats could avoid another tech meltdown like the one that afflicted the Iowa caucuses with a better strategy for building the tools they need, progressive technology specialists say. The origins of the Iowa debacle are in a boom-and-bust cycle that places technology in competition with other priorities as time-crunched campaigns grapple with how best to spend as they hurtle toward an election. "The easy way to spend money, that's reliable, is on advertising," says Evan Henshaw-Plath, a technologist who has built applications for progressive causes and was an early employee at Twitter. "Spending money on technology is riskier and may or may not pay off." When campaigns commence, they hire staff, open offices, buy ads. When the campaign ends, the contracts end and the offices close. Code that is written is often abandoned and forgotten. "We're rebuilding everything from scratch each cycle for everything that isn't finance and compliance," Henshaw-Plath says. "We aren't funding organizations that can survive from one cycle to the next," he adds. "We aren't funding the technology to be maintained from one cycle to the next. And we aren't releasing the code in a maintainable way and picking up again on the next cycle." Light falls on Shadow After the Iowa caucus, the spotlight swung to Shadow, the small tech company that built the glitchy application that precinct chairs were supposed to use to report results. Shadow's primary business is operating two applications for the progressive movement: a messaging product and a data integration tool. The caucus app's lackluster performance brought scrutiny of the connections between Shadow, its main investor Acronym, and various figures and campaigns in the Democratic Party. Such connections are no surprise in this corner of the tech world: It's common practice for Democratic candidates and Democrat-aligned causes to use political tools and technologies developed specifically for the left. There are essentially separate, parallel universes of tech vendors that develop tools for either Democrats or Republicans — but not both. "It is a pretty deeply held value within the progressive community that you want to put your money where your values are," says Brady Kriss, the founder and executive director of Ragtag, a company that corrals tech workers who want to volunteer their skills to help progressive causes. "It's not just about political competition. You don't want your money in any way, directly or indirectly, to go towards supporting issues or candidates that you find morally problematic." Some tech experts have said that using popular mainstream applications like Google Forms might have been a better choice for Iowa, rather than relying on a custom-designed app built on a small budget under time pressure.  Using products already in wide commercial use has another benefit: They're likely to be supported and maintained. "If you're building on top of that, you don't have to worry about that infrastructure," Kriss says. "That really helps with the cyclical nature of campaigns and campaign tech. Because it's very, very hard to keep a small application like a phone app or a large database base application updated when every other year, no one cares." Building beyond the campaign cycle Advocates and entrepreneurs have tried to target the boom-bust dynamic. Higher Ground Labs — a venture capital firm with the mission of supporting progressive tech companies "for experimentation and iteration that's no longer dependent on election dates" — was an investor in the company went on to become Shadow. But Ann Lewis, chief technology officer for MoveOn.org, says that cyclical fundraising cycles continue to affect progressive tech vendors. One particular challenge she has noticed: A lot of the money for tech arrives in September, just two months before a November election. "That's often not enough time to really take advantage of the surge of funding in software teams," she says. What more money often buys is more staff — but adding engineers to a tech project only a few months before launch actually can hinder the team's speed and efficiency, Lewis says. Recurring donations can smooth out spiky funding. But when it comes to structural change, Lewis has one big request: open-source software, frameworks and collaboration spaces. Open-source software means anyone can access and build on the code. The most common place for developers to share their code and collaborate is the online platform GitHub. If political tech developers did make more software open source, Lewis says they might be able to break free from election-driven peaks and valleys — and sustain applications long enough to make them relevant for more than one campaign cycle. "Not all projects will be successful and not all projects will live forever. There's a constant evolution in the frameworks and tools that we use to build any kind of software," she says. "But I think investing in open source early is a way to let the best software rise to the top and live past that campaign horizon."

 Peggy Gibson sits in her living room with her service dog, Rocky, in West Jefferson, N.C., last November. Gibson says Rocky, a diabetic alert dog, isn't able to work well in public. It's a few minutes before services on a Sunday morning at Bethany United Methodist Church in West Jefferson, N.C. The handbell choir warms up and an acolyte lights candles. Church member Peggy Lynn Gibson walks in with her dog, a stout, cream-colored golden retriever named Rocky. The congregants greet Rocky like an old friend. "How are you? You're a sweetheart," one man says to the dog. "And so are you," the man tells Gibson. Pastor Dan Money welcomes the congregation as Rocky, an honorary church member, settles in at Gibson's feet in a pew near the back. "We love Rocky, right? And we love Peggy," Money says from the pulpit on the day NPR visited. Gibson, a 67-year-old retired nurse, is one of more than a million Americans with Type 1 diabetes, a difficult-to-manage autoimmune disease. People with the disease face a constant struggle to control the amount of sugar in their bloodstream. If it gets too low, it can lead to seizures, loss of consciousness, or death. And Rocky was there to help. He's a diabetic alert dog specially trained to smell dangerous changes in someone's blood sugar and alert them with a paw or a nudge before it becomes a medical emergency, and he was a gift from the church community. A chili lunch, a silent auction, even a concert by local musicians all helped with his $15,000 price tag.

 Peggy Gibson (left) guides her diabetic alert dog Rocky outside as she talks with a friend following a church service at Bethany United Methodist Church in West Jefferson, N.C., on July 7, 2019. The congregation helped Gibson raise the money to purchase Rocky. Back at her home just outside West Jefferson's picture postcard downtown, Gibson talked about why she sought canine help. "In these senior years, it became harder to recognize whether my blood sugar was going too high or whether it was going too low. That was partly what prompted me to look into getting a diabetic alert service dog," she says. But while Gibson obviously loves Rocky, he doesn't provide the service she and her neighbors paid for. Unfortunately, that may be par for the course. The diabetic alert dog industry is unstandardized and largely unregulated. And the science on a dog's ability to reliably sniff out blood sugar changes is, at best, inconclusive. Gibson says she was influenced by the online marketing campaign of Diabetic Alert Dogs of America, the Nevada company that sold Rocky. "They have their stories on there about the dogs they've trained and the people they've placed them with. And, you know, it [seemed] sound to me," Gibson says. If you research diabetic alert dogs, you'll find a lot of hope for their role in managing Type 1 diabetes. And you'll find a fair amount of hype. Television news stories about the dogs often uncritically accept their abilities, using words like "incredible" and "amazing." In fundraising campaigns, would-be alert dog owners position them as critical solutions to their disease. NPR reviewed nearly 500 active GoFundMe campaigns that mention "diabetic alert dog." More than a third used phrases like "lifesaver" or "lifesaving."

 Service dogs in training at Diabetic Alert Dogs of America take part in the JDRF One Walk in Las Vegas. JDRF is a research and advocacy group dedicated to curing Type 1 diabetes. Dog training companies make similar claims. Several of them have faced lawsuits or complaints recently from consumers who bought diabetic alert dogs that they say don't work. In Texas, a group of more than a dozen dog buyers sued a trainer for fraud and won a judgment for $800,000. In Virginia, the attorney general sued a service dog vendor after customer complaints about its dogs, which were marketed as "backed by science" and "100 percent effective." The Virginia attorney general claimed that the company, Service Dogs By Warren Retrievers, deceived consumers about the animals' abilities and cost, in many cases simply selling "a $25,000 pet." Company lawyer Glen Franklin Koontz tells NPR his client denies the allegations and calls the lawsuit "baseless." He stands by the "backed by science" claim and adds: "A fully trained dog is 100 percent effective." The reason it might take a lawsuit to fight back against perceived or actual shortcomings in an alert dog is that trainers and dogs generally aren't required by any authority or regulator to perform to any particular standards. While Rocky was marketed as a "certified" alert dog, the certification came only from the company that sold the dog. Soon after Gibson got Rocky, it was clear to her that he wasn't cut out to be a service dog in public, especially in the windy high country of North Carolina. Gibson says Rocky is easily frightened by common noises such as umbrellas opening and motorcycles passing, and can't work as an alert dog while he's scared. "The first day that I had him out on my own, the wind blew up. He got so scared that he couldn't run fast enough to try to hide," Gibson says. "It was just pure fear." That was in April 2017, right after she had to sign a series of disclaimers as a condition of getting the dog. One document said Rocky "met her expectations as a diabetic alert dog," even though she had only two days' experience with him. Another document said Rocky has a "free will" and wasn't guaranteed to do what Gibson and her community paid $15,000 for: alert her to blood sugar changes. "I answered everything because I was so excited that he was there and I was positive," Gibson says. "I was hoping everything was going to be wonderful and then after the dust settled, everything wasn't wonderful." One paper she signed said Rocky wasn't guaranteed to "perform any specific action at any specific time." The sweeping disclaimer might sound at odds with an expensive purchase that people trust with their lives. But research on alert dogs suggests it might also be a reality check about the abilities of diabetic alert dogs in general. University of Virginia psychologist Linda Gonder-Frederick tracked the performance of 14 diabetic alert dogs in a 2017 study. Before the study, their owners believed the dogs would prove more accurate than their glucose monitor devices. That didn't happen. "Overall, they really were not that reliable or accurate," she says. Of 14 dogs in the study, only three performed better than statistical chance. That's similar to what an Oregon researcher reported in 2016. The dogs in that study detected low blood sugar events 36% of the time. They also had false positives. Only 12% of the dogs' alerts happened during actual low blood sugar events.

 Ed Peeples (center) takes part in the JDRF One Walk, which raises money to research Type 1 diabetes, in Las Vegas. Peeples is a co-owner of the company Diabetic Alert Dogs of America. Gonder-Frederick says some dog owners overestimate their beloved dogs' talents, perhaps as they would a favored grandchild. "People might notice and remember when the dog is accurate much more easily than they would notice or remember when the dog was not accurate," she says. "You find a person who believes very strongly in their dog, when in fact maybe the dog's right half the time." The psychological process at work, she says, is a kind of confirmation bias. Her research also contradicted what some believe — or hope — is true: That the dogs can be a good safety net for those who worry about blood sugar dropping as they sleep. Some parents have turned to the dogs to safeguard their children during the night. "The accuracy just plummeted during the night. Dogs have to sleep too. Obviously, a dog cannot work 24/7," Gonder-Frederick says. There's not too much other research, but what does exist isn't more encouraging. A study published in 2015 and a 2019 British study did find good performance but involved possible conflicts of interest. Both studies were co-written by the dogs' trainers or suppliers. Authors of both articles tell NPR the arrangements did not amount to conflicts and didn't bias the studies. Edwin Peeples, who co-owns Diabetic Alert Dogs of America, says he has trained nearly 700 dogs and more than 9 out of 10 of his clients are satisfied. He says issues like Gibson's — where a dog can't perform well in public — represent the toughest part of training an alert dog, and that he does his best to train the dog to work in the owner's environment. And for dogs that don't work out, Peeples says he has a training guarantee. "They can bring that dog to my doorstep right here in Las Vegas," Peeples says. "Our response will be: I will do my absolute best to try to fix it, and if I can't, you get a brand-new dog." But Jessica Moye, an Ohio mom with Type 1 diabetes, had a long-running dispute with Peeples and now helps run a Facebook group dedicated to complaints about Peeples' company. She says the replacement dog guarantee can mean little when there's a child involved.

 Jessica Moye spent $11,000 on Hachi, who Moye says has not been reliable as a diabetic alert dog. "The child bonds with the dog, and then they have to choose whether or not to send the dog back and start over again, looking for that lifesaving alert," Moye says. "Or if they just let their child go on with life with this dog, regardless of the fact that it isn't working for them." Moye got her dog, Hachi, in 2016 and paid Peeples' company $11,000 for him. Hachi was supposed to paw her if her blood sugar was out of range. "Hachi was never a reliable alerter. If I got into his face and asked for the paw, sure, he would give me his paw," Moye says. "But there was never any link to the scent of my breath and whether my blood sugar was high or whether my blood sugar was low."

 A book from Diabetic Alert Dogs of America sits in the home of Jessica Moye, who purchased her dog Hachi from the company. When Peeples agreed to refund some of her money, it was conditioned on her signing a nondisclosure agreement barring her from discussing the company with others. He says he required the agreement because he didn't want it publicly known that he was providing a refund. She refused to sign, leaving several thousand dollars on the table. Now, through the Facebook group, Moye says she's heard from dozens of Peeples' clients. Some have struggled with dogs that are too aggressive or have other problems. Some are happy. While researchers have found little evidence that dogs can reliably sniff out blood sugar changes, they have encountered a kind of paradox: People who get alert dogs tend to do better with their diabetes. "They may just be more engaged with their diabetes," says Gonder-Frederick, the researcher. "They may be checking their blood glucose much more often than they used to. The dog is sort of a pleasant reminder of diabetes." 
                Jessica Moye spends time with Hachi in her yard outside Columbus, Ohio, on Oct. 30. Moye helps run a Facebook group dedicated to complaints about the company Diabetic Alert Dogs of America.

That's despite the fact that, she says, he doesn't work well when he's scared from a thunderstorm or some other noise and doesn't alert her to blood sugar changes at the rate she says the vendor promised — 80% of the time. Also, she complains that he was trained to alert her by jumping on her, and she says he's more than half her weight. Still, Gibson says: "There will be just times that he'll come and put his head on my leg and just look up at me —  as if he understands in some way what I'm going through. He's always there for me." But, she says, "I felt sorry that Rocky as an animal was chosen to do a job he wasn't equipped to do. That's not fair to the animal. Neither is it fair to me as the recipient of a $15,000 specially trained dog that isn't capable of doing his job." She says she plans to try to retrain Rocky herself, and despite his "guarantee," she has no plans to send him back. Huo Jingnan and Cat Schuknecht contributed to this story.

 Emergency workers in protective clothing exit the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship where it was being resupplied Monday off Yokohama, Japan. Updated at 9:51 a.m. ET The Diamond Princess cruise ship has become a symbol of a global health nightmare. To date, 175 cases of the coronavirus — the infectious disease the World Health Organization is now calling COVID-19 — have been confirmed aboard the ship. David Abel is one of the remaining 3,600 people on board, quarantined in waters off the coast of Japan until at least Feb. 19. He's been documenting life in quarantine: Medical staff doing checkups through the night, small boats ferrying supplies of food and medicine.  Abel told Britain's Channel 4 News: "24/7, we are not allowed to open the door until there is a knock on the door and they bring the food to us. Other than that, we are like prisoners." Keeping the spread of the virus contained in those close quarters is not only a big medical and logistical challenge, it could also take a big bite out of the cruise line business this year. "Ugh, everything's down," laments Monish Luthra, president and CEO of Odysseus Solutions, a Miami software company that handles bookings for cruise companies.  About 10 days ago, he says, reservations started to plummet, starting with flight bookings in Asia. "We've seen about a 40% drop" in cruise bookings, Luthra says. What's worse, it's peak booking season for cruise lines. Luthra himself is scheduled to embark on a cruise out of Sydney in about a week. Originally, he was supposed to fly through Hong Kong, but he rerouted to avoid that virus hot zone. He says he still loves cruising, but can't imagine spending weeks holed up with his two kids. "I wouldn't know how to explain it to my 6 year old or my 8 year old why they can't leave that room," he says. China makes up a small, but growing segment of the $45 billion cruise industry, says Emily Flippen, a senior analyst with The Motley Fool. "This is a major setback," she says. Meanwhile, another cruise liner, Holland America's MS Westerdam, has been drifting around Asia, having been denied entry at five different ports, despite the fact it has no confirmed cases of the virus. The ship is now sailing for Cambodia, where the cruise will end Thursday, Holland America said Wednesday. But the outbreak is not a widespread problem that will affect the industry long term, says Brian Salerno, senior vice president of maritime policy of the Cruise Line Industry Association. He says the industry was quick to take precautions, from screening anyone who's sick, or denying entry to anyone who recently traveled to China, or who was in contact with someone there.  Plus, he argues, the ships themselves are safe because medical care is on board. "When you take a cruise at a cruise ship, you're traveling with your hospital in a sense," he says. The cruise industry has shaken off worse crises, says Gene Sloan, a writer for The Points Guy, a travel website.  Remember the dramatic sinking of the Costa Concordia that killed 32 people? "At the time, there was a lot of speculation this is gonna kill the cruise business," he says.  Every year brings a new challenge: norovirus, Zika, hurricanes, or loss of power. Sloan says the cruise industry has grown through them all. So this virus, too, shall pass.

 Solar panels on a roof of one of the largest apartment complexes in New York City, installed by private equity firm The Blackstone Group. Fifteen years ago, pursuing solar energy was so expensive that it seemed like a pipe dream in the development of alternative energies. Since then, government incentives and competition in the market have brought the price of solar down by what economist Ben Ho calls "a magical amount of money."  Today, the price of solar energy is cheaper even than coal - traditionally the cheapest form of energy out there. Now major companies are investing millions of dollars in solar power, including The Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, known for making lots of money. It recently made the decision to install thousands of solar panels on the roof of one of its apartment complexes and has plans to expand its solar investment. And the reason is all about cost savings.  On today's show, we talk to Ben Ho about the price of solar, or what he says is "the most important indicator of all time."  Music by Drop Electric.

 President Trump's proposed budget projects federal deficits until 2035. There was a time when congressional Republicans railed against the budget deficit. In recent history, think of the Tea Party movement, whose members called for driving down debt, deficits and government spending. And President Trump himself, on the campaign trail in 2016, pledged to brighten the nation's fiscal picture, which includes deficits — the annual difference between how much the government spends and how much it takes in — and the national debt, which is the accumulation of deficits. But the U.S. deficit has soared, and the budget proposal he unveiled Monday is no match for it. So where have the GOP deficit hawks gone?

 "Retirement, to heaven I hope," says William Hoagland, who served for 25 years helping to shape GOP budget policy in the U.S. Senate. He's now with the Bipartisan Policy Center. "Right now it's not an issue for the American public I think is the problem. We have [a] low unemployment rate, we have low inflation, people don't see what the damages are being caused by these debt and deficits. So, party on." Trump's fiscal 2018 budget projected that next year's deficit would be $456 billion. But Monday's budget predicts it would be $966 billion under the policies laid out in his latest plan. That budget blueprint projects deficits until 2035. The budget predicts deficits would come down eventually because of cuts Trump would make to agencies. But, Hoagland says, that's not realistic. "Getting to reduce the level of debt out there is important," he says. "But quite frankly I think it takes an awful long time to adjust the spending patterns of this country to get to it. And I'm not seeing the leadership out of the White House or out of the Congress to actually take on some of the tough decisions that are necessary to reduce the debt." On the days when the Tea Party was critical of deficits under the Obama administration The Tea Party was focusing on that portion of the budget that I think was not the "problem child" for what's creating some of the debt and deficits that we have. And the Tea Party was focusing not on any kind of increasing revenues — in fact cutting taxes, not increasing taxes. And so I could never square the circle with the Tea Party that they could actually talk about real reductions in the debt and deficits by the nature of where they were focusing. They were focusing their attention on reducing those things in the government which I consider to be the seed corn of the future such as infrastructure, transportation, science, technology. It's hard, if you're really serious about reducing debts and deficits on the spending side, you have to take on the politically challenging issues that are the mandatory programs [like Social Security and Medicare]. On whether Democrats' argument that Republicans only care about deficits when they're not in power is fair Well I think it's fair ... today to say that. I don't think it's always been that case, but I think it's fair to say that's the situation today. On deficit talk in the 2020 presidential election Interestingly enough, the young mayor from Indiana [former South Bend mayor and democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg] — and I'm from Indiana, so a little biased here — ... is talking about it as an issue, which I think is important because it's his generation that's going to be impacted most by the fact that this debt and deficit accumulating is a tax on that generation. On when the U.S. can take steps to curb deficit spending if policymakers are not doing so now  That is the question. I use the analogy that Charles Schultze [the late economist at the Brookings Institution] used to use, which is that it's like termites under the front porch. They're out there, they're working away, this debt and deficits accumulating — this is the highest level that we've had in a peacetime period. Those termites are eating away. Someday you're going to step out on that porch and you're going to fall through. It's unclear when that happens. I still believe that's going to happen unless we start addressing it. The other factor I would say is: Maybe this generation never addresses it, but what it does is it creates more pressure on future generations to pay the taxes or the interest payments on the debt that's accumulated by this current generation. Long after many of the members are gone, it will come ... reducing the growth of this country in the future and putting pressure on ... our children and our grandchildren.

Judge Rules In Favor Of T-Mobile Takeover Of Sprint,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/11/804848534/judge-rules-in-favor-of-t-mobile-takeover-of-sprint,February 11, 2020,

 A federal judge ruled in favor of T-Mobile's takeover of Sprint in a merger that would combine the country's third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers. T-Mobile is closer to taking over Sprint after a federal judge rejected arguments by several states that the merger would stifle competition and lead to higher prices for consumers. The deal would combine the country's third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers. The new company, to be called T-Mobile, would still be the third-largest, after AT&T and Verizon.  U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero concluded that the proposed merger "is not reasonably likely to substantially lessen competition" in the wireless market.  In his ruling Tuesday, Marrero said he was persuaded not to presume anticompetitive effects, as T-Mobile "has redefined itself over the past decade as a maverick that has spurred the two largest players in its industry to make numerous pro-consumer changes." He said that Sprint, meanwhile, "is falling farther and farther short of the targets it must hit to remain relevant." Marrero was not convinced that Sprint is likely to survive as a major competitor. The case was brought by the attorneys general of New York, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia. The Justice Department has already approved the deal, which was valued at $26.5 billion when the merger was announced in 2018. The merger remains subject to closing conditions and the possibility of further court proceedings. New York Attorney General Letitia James said the states are considering an appeal. "From the start, this merger has been about massive corporate profits over all else, and despite the companies' false claims, this deal will endanger wireless subscribers where it hurts most: their wallets," James said in a statement. "There is no doubt that reducing the mobile market from four to three will be bad for consumers, bad for workers, and bad for innovation, which is why the states stepped up and led this lawsuit." Part of the agreement is the combined company would help establish Dish Network as a fourth major wireless company. Sprint's prepaid customers would be moved to Dish, while most of Sprint's other customers would have plans through T-Mobile. Sprint and T-Mobile cheered Marrero's ruling. The companies say the merger would allow them to build a nationwide 5G network more quickly. "[N]ow we are FINALLY able to focus on the last steps to get this merger done!" T-Mobile CEO John Legere said in a statement. "We want to thank the Court for its thorough review of the facts we presented in our case. We've said it all along: the New T-Mobile will be a supercharged Un-carrier that is great for consumers and great for competition." Shares of both Sprint and T-Mobile rose early Tuesday on news of the ruling.

 Olivia Freiwald, 20, of the New Hampshire Youth Movement and Sunrise Movement on the main campus of the University of New Hampshire. She's campaigning for Bernie Sanders, in part, because he pledges to ban fracking. Updated at 10:20 a.m. Climate change is a top issue in the Democratic presidential primaries and some candidates have taken relatively aggressive policy stands, including vows to ban hydraulic fracturing. But some Democrats worry that could push moderate voters in key swing states to reelect President Trump next November. Fracking is a controversial drilling technology that, along with horizontal drilling, has created a major oil and gas boom. President Trump often brags about this on the campaign trail, though the boom started well before he became president. While the president largely dismisses the effects of climate change, Democrats have made addressing the issue a key element of their energy and environment platforms. Last September, Elizabeth Warren tweeted she would, "ban fracking—everywhere." Bernie Sanders talked about banning fracking during his 2016 run for president. For both, fracking is one element of their support for a sweeping "Green New Deal." Sanders' environmental platform is one reason volunteers with the New Hampshire Youth Movement have deployed across six campuses asking students to vote for the U.S. senator from neighboring Vermont. The organization is affiliated with the youth climate group Sunrise Movement, which has endorsed Sanders. Twenty-year-old volunteer Olivia Freiwald of Wynnewood, Pa., clipboard in hand, says she's taken a year off from studying at Tufts University to campaign full time. At the University of New Hampshire recently, she dismissed concerns that Sanders' environmental policies might alienate moderate voters and help reelect Trump in swing states. "I get this question, literally, all the time, especially from people in my parent's generation," she says. Freiwald says those who ask are "hyper-obsessed" with finding a candidate who can beat Trump, but she thinks there are larger issues to consider, such as climate change. "I just hear them being scared, and I hear them not knowing the full scale of the crisis we are facing."  Scientists warn that carbon emissions must be reduced dramatically, and quickly, to avoid the worst effects of climate change. For Freiwald and her fellow activists, the solution is a complete transition from fossil fuels. There are some actions a president could take to limit fracking, especially on federal land and in federal waters.  But a complete ban likely would require congressional action, and that would be difficult, especially if Republicans control one or both houses of congress.  Still, the oil industry has taken notice of the Democrats' proposals. Ads from the American Petroleum Institute tout the environmental benefits of expanding natural gas for electricity generation, since it emits about half the carbon emissions as coal. Those ads ignore concerns about methane, a more potent greenhouse gas, emitted during gas production. Other ads explicitly call on voters to oppose fracking bans. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce commissioned a study that predicts job losses that would come with a fracking ban. "The first five years or so, you're going to lose 19 million jobs around the country," says Marty Durbin, president of the Chamber's Global Energy Institute. The study predicts job losses well beyond oil and gas. Fracking ban supporters, though, imagine a much different future, with a big increase in renewable energy jobs. Durbin and others in the oil industry aren't trying to change activists' minds. Instead they're focused on moderate and swing voters who could decide the next election in a closely divided country. "The middle of the electorate understands our need for energy itself, for it to be affordable, for it to be reliable, and for it to be clean," says Durbin. In a swing state like Pennsylvania, a major gas producer, fracking and energy are key issues. Even a small segment of voters swayed one way or another could change the election. "Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes in 2016 were decided by about 44,000 votes, or less than 1% of the electorate in that race," says Chris Borick, Professor of Political Science and Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. He thinks the effect of a candidate's relatively aggressive environmental policies shouldn't be underestimated. But for all focus on climate change among the most engaged Democrats — it was the number two issue for caucus goers in Iowa — moderate and swing voters are not paying as much attention. "Energy and climate issues are not among the top tier of issues that voters identify as their top priority," Borick says. In suburban Philadelphia, Meeta Patel is a good example of that. She voted for Trump in 2016 and Barack Obama before that. So far this election year she's undecided. "I want to make sure," says Patel, "who is the other candidate that I'm comparing Trump against." Asked how a candidate's views on fracking will affect her choice, Patel says for now she's thinking more about the cost of health insurance and her son's college education.

 President Trump meets with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella (center) and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos at the White House on June 19, 2017. The Pentagon has selected Microsoft for a $10 billion cloud computing contract also sought by Amazon. Updated at 1:05 p.m. ET Amazon wants President Trump and Defense Secretary Mark Esper to testify about a massive military tech contract that the company lost to Microsoft, according to court documents unsealed Monday. Amazon has taken the Pentagon to court, alleging "unmistakable bias" on the government's part in awarding to rival Microsoft the $10 billion cloud-computing contract, known as JEDI.  The contract award process had been mired by months of delays, investigations and controversy — at first over allegations of cozy relationships between Amazon and the Pentagon, and later over Trump's public criticism of the company, its role in the JEDI bidding and its CEO Jeff Bezos. Bezos owns The Washington Post, whose news coverage Trump often criticizes. Newly unsealed documents show Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud arm, is seeking to depose Trump "about conversations or other involvement he had regarding the JEDI bid process or efforts to harm Amazon or AWS." The request acknowledges that deposing a sitting president "presents unique circumstances." Amazon is also requesting testimony from Esper, former Defense Secretary James Mattis, Defense Department Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy and other officials involved in the selecting of the contract winner, whose names were redacted. The White House and the Justice Department declined to comment on Monday. A Defense Department representative did not immediate respond to NPR's inquiry. The Pentagon had previously said the contract review evaluated all bidders fairly and consistently with the stated criteria. In a statement on Monday, AWS maintained its allegation that Trump used the military budget to pursue his own ends. "President Trump has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to use his position as President and Commander in Chief to interfere with government functions — including federal procurements — to advance his personal agenda," the company said. Amazon is challenging the Pentagon's award of JEDI, for Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The company had also sought to block Microsoft and the Pentagon from starting work on the contract while the litigation is ongoing, but the court has not yet ruled on that. Amazon was stunned by its loss of the JEDI contract. Microsoft's cloud business Azure has been a distant second in size to AWS, which also previously won a cloud contract with the CIA. A former Pentagon official familiar with the JEDI deal previously told NPR that Microsoft's bid "hit the ball out of the park."  Editor's Note: Amazon and Microsoft are among NPR's recent financial supporters. NPR researcher Sarah Knight contributed to this report.
British Airways Sets Record, Crossing The Atlantic In Under 5 Hours In Strong Winds,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/09/804266975/british-airways-sets-speed-record-crossing-the-atlantic-in-under-5-hours,February 9, 2020,

 British Airways Flight 112 flew from New York to London in under five hours, setting a new record. Kubilay Kahveci's flight was supposed to be in the air for more than six hours — an overnight voyage from New York City to London. But British Airways Flight 112 made the trek in under five hours, setting a new record for the fastest subsonic commercial flight across the Atlantic Ocean. "I was definitely surprised. It felt like a European flight rather than a transatlantic one," Kahveci told NPR in an email. "Turbulence woke me up a couple of times. ... But it wasn't too bad after all and I'm glad they brought us home safely because I initially booked a Virgin Atlantic flight that was cancelled due to Storm Ciara." Propelled by strong winds, the Boeing 747 at its fastest topped a ground speed of 800 miles per hour, according to global flight-tracking service Flightradar24. British Airways confirmed that the flight took 4 hours, 56 minutes, beating the previous 2018 record by Norwegian, which flew from New York to London in 5 hours, 13 minutes. "That was the first time that we've seen it below five hours," said Flightradar24's Ian Petchenik. "This particular speed hasn't happened before, but those increased speeds across the Atlantic happen on a fairly regular basis, especially in the winter when the jet stream kind of dips down into where the North Atlantic Tracks are and is a bit stronger." Severe storms around the United Kingdom have been causing lots of flight delays, cancellations and diversions. But the wind conditions made for very fast eastbound flights, a few of which on Sunday crossed the Atlantic under the five-hour mark. Petchenik said the New York-London route has historically been used as a speed benchmark for trans-Atlantic air travel. "We always prioritise safety over speed records," British Airways wrote in its brief statement to NPR on Sunday, "but our highly trained pilots made the most of the conditions to get customers back to London well ahead of time." By Petchenik's estimate, the jet stream winds may have added roughly 150 miles per hour to the airplane's speed. "We knew that the jet stream was going to be very well placed this week to possibly break that record," he said, explaining that subsonic speeds are measured against the ground.

 "Relative to the airflow around it, it's not going faster," Petchenik said. "It's still traveling at the same speed that it normally travels relative to the air. The air itself is moving faster." Kahveci, who was coming back from a business trip on Flight BA112, said the captain did announce after the landing that the flight was the quickest subsonic British Airways flight from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to London's Heathrow Airport — but did not mention that it was the fastest overall on the route. "It's just bragging rights," Petchenik said. "I don't think there's a plaque handed out, though that would be neat." NPR's Julia Holmes Bailey contributed to this report.

 Douglas Hodge, shown last October outside the federal courthouse in Boston, has been sentenced to nine months in prison. A federal judge in Boston has handed down the stiffest penalty yet in the massive college admissions scandal. Douglas Hodge, the former CEO of the global investment giant PIMCO, has been sentenced to nine months in prison.  U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton also sentenced Hodge, 61, to two years of supervised release and 500 hours of community service. He also must pay a fine of $750,000.  The sentence is much less than the 24 months prosecutors were seeking for Hodge. But it's also far longer than the sentences to date of others involved in the scandal. For example, actress Felicity Huffman was released after 11 days of a 14-day sentence. And former Stanford sailing coach John Vandemoer did not face jail time – he was sentenced to two years of supervised release.  Some 15 people have pleaded guilty and have been sentenced to date, according to The Associated Press. Last March, the Justice Department charged 50 people for their alleged roles in the fraud, which involved allegedly cheating on standardized tests or falsifying athletic achievements to increase the chances that the children of wealthy parents would be admitted to elite colleges.  In some cases, including Hodge's, parents bribed coaches at elite universities in order to get their children designated as athletic recruits. Prosecutors say that he paid some $850,000 to help secure admission for his four children – two at University of Southern California and two at Georgetown University. In October, Hodge pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.  "I have in my heart the deepest remorse for my actions," he said in a letter to the judge last month. "I know that I unfairly, and ultimately illegally, tipped the scales in favor of my children over others, over the hopes and dreams of other parents, who had the same aspirations for their children as I did for mine." "I am accountable for my actions, and I am prepared to accept the consequences of my wrongful conduct," he said.  His lawyers added that Hodge plans to "redouble his efforts to create educational opportunities for underserved children." They pleaded for the court to hand down a "just sentence that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary." Prosecutors told the court that they considered Hodge among the "most culpable" of the parents charged. They described him as a repeat player, "who engaged in the conspiracy again and again, over years." According to prosecutors, in 2008, Hodge first paid for a Georgetown tennis coach to fraudulently recruit his daughter, making it easier for her to obtain admission to the elite university. As part of the scheme, the mastermind behind the cheating scheme, Rick Singer, fabricated the girl's tennis accomplishments. For example, the application claimed that she had built a tennis court in a Cambodian jungle.  Prosecutors say that Hodge carried out the same type of fraud two years later to secure his son admission to Georgetown, claiming that he was "one of Japan's top youth tennis players" even though he was not competitive in the sport.  In 2013, his younger daughter was admitted to USC with an application that claimed she was "co-captain of a Japanese national soccer team," court documents stated. The next year, he agreed to pay bribes to get his son admitted to USC as a football recruit.   Prosecutors say he also tried to use bribes to gain a fifth child admission to Loyola Marymount University, but did not succeed.

 The ratio of the unemployment rate of black workers to white workers in the U.S. is two to one. It's Jobs Friday, and today's jobs report shows the unemployment rate has remained low, at 3.6 percent. For white workers, the rate is even lower, close to 3 percent. But for African-American workers, the unemployment rate is double that, at 6 percent.  This ratio of two to one for black to white unemployment rates in the U.S. has persisted since the 1970s, regardless of the state of the economy. It's known as the racial unemployment gap. Economist Gbenga Ajilore joins us to discuss what has contributed to this disparity, and how systemic changes can start to narrow the gap.

From Delivery Trucks To Scooter-Moving Vans, Fleets Are Going Electric,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/07/803145517/from-delivery-trucks-to-scooter-moving-vans-fleets-are-going-electric,February 7, 2020,

 Electric vans charge at a warehouse of the German postal and logistics service Deutsche Post near Frankfurt in July 2018. Fleet vehicles are increasingly going electric in Europe and China, and some analysts say American fleets will be following suit. As electric cars grow in popularity and visibility, experts say a revolution is coming in a place most people overlook: corporate and municipal fleets. The scooter company Lime is the latest firm to announce that it plans to completely remove gas- and diesel-powered vehicles from its fleet and power its new electric work vehicles with renewable energy. Lime is famous, of course, for electric vehicles — the small battery-powered scooters that have popped up on sidewalks across the United States. And as the world's largest scooter company, it promotes itself as an eco-friendly alternative to driving. But so far, some gas-guzzling is still involved behind the scenes. "All of our scooters and e-bikes are already electric, already powered by renewables," says Andrew Savage, the head of sustainability at Lime. "We're going to take the vans and the vehicles used to manage those programs and transition those to zero emissions as well." Lime's fleet isn't large — a few hundred vehicles for now. But the company is not alone in plotting the switch. Lime, along with companies like Ikea and Unilever, is joining the EV100 initiative to commit to an all-electric fleet. Other large companies, such as DHL, Amazon and AT&T, have committed to "accelerating" the transition to electric fleet vehicles. Millions of fleet vehicles are on the road — everything from delivery trucks and maintenance vans to police cars and school buses. Right now, less than 1% of those vehicles are electric, according to the consulting firm Guidehouse (formerly known as Navigant).  But in a decade, the group predicts that 12% of fleet vehicles will be plug-ins. That will mean a rise from about 2 million electric fleet vehicles now to more than 70 million in 2030.  "Given the life span of vehicles ... 12% [of the] population will require a significant portion of new vehicles sold being plug-in electric vehicles," says Guidehouse's Ted Walker. Interest in sustainability will drive some of that growth. Companies like Lime that market themselves as climate friendly or have made climate pledges to investors and partners need to reduce the emissions from their fleets in order to restrain emissions. And around the world — particularly in Europe and China — government pressure is spurring investment in electric vehicles of all types. But there are other factors too. In some ways, selling electric vehicles to companies is easier than selling one to an individual car owner. Consider the price. "Electric vehicles are going to have a higher purchase price, but there's a lower maintenance, lower fuel cost," Walker says. Where an individual might focus on the sticker shock, a company is more likely to consider the lifetime cost of the vehicle. Then there's range anxiety. It takes longer to charge a battery than to fill up a gas tank, and some people (particularly those who have never owned or leased an electric vehicle) worry that they'll go on a long trip and run out of juice. The concern is common even for drivers who very rarely drive long distances. Fleet operators think differently; they know how far their cars go in a day, says Steve Burns, the CEO of Lordstown Motors. The Ohio startup is making a pickup truck specifically to sell to fleets. "We are catering mostly to people that stay local — whether that's a florist, a landscaper, a police officer," Burns says. "[Our truck] can go 250 miles on a charge. Most of these type of folks go 60 or 70 miles a day." There are some logistical challenges — fleet operators have to set up charging infrastructure in their garages or parking lots, for instance. But there's another obstacle. Lordstown Motors' truck, the Endurance, isn't available yet. No mass-production electric pickup has yet arrived on the U.S. market. And in America, options for vans and other work vehicles are similarly slim. "It's only a small handful, and the supply is actually quite constrained," says Savage, of Lime. So companies are expressing their interest in electric fleets partly as a signal to automakers — that they need to catch up with demand.

 Unusually warm weather contributed to a surge in construction last month, with 44,000 jobs added. Updated at 11:23 a.m. ET  The U.S. labor market revved up in January, with employers adding 225,000 jobs. That's well above the number forecasters were expecting. The unemployment rate inched up to 3.6%, near a 50-year low, according to a new report from the Labor Department. Employment growth for November and December was also revised upwards by a total of 7,000 jobs.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Unusually warm weather contributed to a surge in construction last month, with 44,000 jobs added. Housing construction has also gotten a boost from low mortgage rates. Hiring was also strong in service industries such as health care, education and hospitality, which have been steadily adding workers month after month. Manufacturing continues to be a weak spot in the economy. Factories cut 12,000 jobs in January, despite signs of a recovery in manufacturing activity following a five-month slump.    "Manufacturing accounts for only 8.4% of payrolls, but it punches above its weight in the eyes of the markets, media and politicians," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "The trend clearly is deteriorating with the sector under pressure from the trade war." White House economist Tomas Philipson said new trade deals with China, Canada and Mexico could give a lift to factory employment.  "We're very optimistic of a rebound in manufacturing taking place," Philipson said. Retailers cut more than 8,000 jobs in a sign that brick-and-mortar stores continue to face pressure from the growth in online sales. By contrast, warehouses and transportation companies — which pack and deliver online purchases — added about 28,000 jobs.  Wage growth picked up a bit in January, though it remains modest given the very low level of unemployment. Over the past 12 months, average wages have risen 3.1%.  That's more than enough to outpace inflation, boosting workers' buying power. But pay increases were higher earlier in the recovery. "We wonder if the key response of businesses to the intensification of the trade war in the summer was to be more aggressive in pay negotiations," Shepherdson said. "If so, we doubt it can last as labor shortages become more acute." The strong job market continues to draw new workers off the sidelines. Philipson estimates nearly three-quarters of new jobs in recent months have gone to people who were not previously looking for work. The share of adults in the labor force increased last month to 63.4%, the highest since 2013. "I think there's still more room for the growth," Philipson said. While the overall job market remains healthy, the Labor Department says past job gains were not as strong as initially reported. Once each year, the department updates its historical employment record using more complete information. Friday's revision shows employers added 514,000 fewer jobs between April 2018 and March 2019 than earlier surveys had indicated. In the 36 months since President Trump took office, the U.S. has added 6.6 million jobs. By comparison, employers added 8.1 million jobs in the 36 months before that.

The Oscars are coming up this weekend, and you may be attending a party where there'll be a pool going to bet on the winners. But legally betting on the Oscars is a relatively new thing, and so far has only been approved in two states, New Jersey and Indiana.  At The Indicator, we have plenty of opinions, particularly on the topics of money and film. So of course we had to head to Atlantic City to place our bet. But before we did, we talked to a few experts to help us make a more educated bet on Best Picture (including our current reigning best-named guest, Spanky Kyrollos).

Bernie Madoff Seeks Early Release Because He Has 'Less Than 18 Months' To Live,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/06/803467419/bernie-madoff-seeks-early-release-because-he-has-less-than-18-months-to-live,February 6, 2020,

 Bernie Madoff, shown here arriving at a court session in 2009, is currently being held at FMC Butner, a federal prison in North Carolina. Bernie Madoff, the mastermind behind a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme that defrauded hundreds of investors, is seeking compassionate release from prison because of terminal kidney failure.  The motion filed by Madoff's lawyer, Brandon Sample, says the 81-year-old suffers from end-stage renal disease and many other chronic medical conditions. He has a life expectancy of less than 18 months, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  "Madoff is experiencing complications, including acid build up, which causes muscle and joint pain, itching, and edema," Sample's motion states. It adds that the former financier is confined to a wheelchair and requires assistance with simple tasks such as grooming.  Sample notes that Abdel Baset Ali al-Megrahi, who was convicted in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988, was released by Scotland in 2009 in light of a terminal diagnosis.  That same year, Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 criminal counts and was sentenced to 150 years in prison. At the time of his sentencing, "it was clear that Madoff's 150-year prison sentence was symbolic for three reasons: retribution, deterrence, and for the victims," the motion states. "Over the past ten years circumstances have changed." "This Court must now consider whether keeping Madoff incarcerated, in light of his terminal kidney failure and a life expectancy of less than 18 months, is truly in furtherance of statutory sentencing goals and our society's value and understanding of compassion," it added.  U.S. Circuit Judge Denny Chin will be deciding whether to grant the request. When he imposed Madoff's sentence more than 10 years ago, he slammed the swindler's actions:  "Here the message must be sent that Mr. Madoff's crimes were extraordinarily evil and that this kind of manipulation of the system is not just a bloodless crime that takes place on paper, but one instead that takes a staggering toll," Chin said, as NPR reported.  The Bureau of Prisons denied Madoff's compassionate release request in December 2019, saying that "in light of the nature and circumstances of his offense, his release at this time would minimize the severity of the offense." It added that Madoff "has refused dialysis and any further testing, including laboratory work," for his condition, though Madoff's lawyer said he began accepting dialysis that same month.   Madoff is currently being held at FMC Butner, a federal prison in North Carolina.  Sample said that if released, Madoff would not work, would support himself through Social Security and Medicare, and would live with a friend. He added that the former Wall Street financier doesn't pose a danger to society.  A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York said that they planned to file a response to the motion.  Madoff's scheme would pay off old investors with money obtained from new investors. Since the scheme was uncovered, lawyers have been able to recover at least 70% — some $13 billion — of the money feared lost. 
Cities And States Are Saying No To Cashless Shops,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/06/803003343/some-businesses-are-going-cashless-but-cities-are-pushing-back,February 6, 2020,

 A sign alerts customers that cash is not accepted at a shop in San Francisco last year. The city subsequently banned businesses from rejecting cash. After almost 10 minutes of standing in line at a coffee shop, Ritchie Torres realized he only had cash in his pocket — a form of payment no longer accepted by this store.  "It was a humiliating experience," he said. "I remember wondering aloud, how could a business refuse to accept cash, which is legal tender?" Torres is a City Council member in New York. He says his constituents, especially seniors, have also complained about a spurt of cashless stores. So Torres led the charge on a bill to ban businesses from rejecting cash, which New York's city leaders passed almost unanimously last month.  A similar ban is slated for a hearing in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 13. In the past year, Philadelphia, San Francisco and the state of New Jersey have also banned cashless stores — a rare case of governments fighting a tech trend before it spreads far. Massachusetts has required establishments to accept cash since 1978. "A cashless economy is not an inclusive economy," said Tazra Mitchell, policy director at the research and advocacy group DC Fiscal Policy Institute. Excluding people from paying with cash means "essentially discriminating against people who are low-income, people who are homeless, also undocumented," she said. Getting a credit or debit card often requires a form of ID, a utility or another bill, money to deposit and a financial history. Mitchell said that in Washington, D.C., nearly a third of residents rely on cash every day because they don't have a card or even a bank account. In fact, as cities have cracked down on the cashless economy and spurred new conversations about whom it leaves out, some of the biggest names that tried going cashless — Amazon's automated convenience store Go and salad chain Sweetgreen — have reversed their policies in favor of accepting cash.  "Going cashless had ... positive results, but it also had the unintended consequence of excluding those who prefer to pay or can only pay with cash," Sweetgreen officials wrote in a Medium post.  These reversals show that the market is working to respond to its communities, said National Retail Federation General Counsel Stephanie Martz. She said new laws are "a solution in search of a problem" as the number of businesses to go cashless is very small — in part because each card transaction comes with a fee the business has to pay.  Credit card companies, which get a cut every time a card is swiped, have rewarded the cashless trend. For example, in 2018, Visa paid $10,000 each to 50 businesses that stopped accepting cash.  And some store owners have argued, cash is inefficient. For example, it slows down the line, requires armored cars, and attracts break-ins or skimming by workers.  And indeed, cash is becoming less popular among U.S. shoppers. The Federal Reserve found in 2018 that cash had stopped being the No. 1 payment choice — overtaken by debit cards.  But cash is still the most common way people pay amounts under $10 or $25 — especially among those older than 55 and younger than 25. And some people prefer cash for privacy reasons — to protect their purchase history from being tracked by advertisers or banks. Cash also might carry potential psychological and financial benefits for consumers. Cash is "going to feel much more painful to give up because we can see it outflow from our hand," said Avni Shah, assistant professor of marketing at the University of Toronto. Her research found that when people pay in cash, they are more mindful of their spending — willing to spend less to begin with — but they also value their purchases more and feel more loyal to the seller. "With cash, we can feel this emotional attachment and we value what we have a bit more," she said. Shah acknowledged that different businesses may have priorities other than loyalty, such as convenience and speed of getting the customer in and out of the store. Opponents of the bans on cashless establishments have argued that businesses should be able to make these decisions for themselves.  "We don't think that in five years laws that ban stores from going cashless are going to look smart," Martz said, envisioning a near future where everyone has access to digital payments thanks to advances in financial technology. In that future, she argued, banning businesses from going cashless could hamstring them from becoming more efficient. But Torres and Mitchell said cashless laws are there to balance technological progress with an economy that's fair and inclusive. 
China Will Cut Tariffs In Half On $75 Billion Of U.S. Products,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/06/803335259/china-will-cut-tariffs-in-half-on-75-billion-of-u-s-products,February 6, 2020, China is slicing tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. products, Chinese government news agencies report. The move is in reciprocation for the Trump administration's plan, announced last month, to halve tariffs on about $112 billion in Chinese goods. The tariff cuts, both slated to take effect on Feb. 14, are the latest sign that the trade war between the world's largest economies is easing. China will drop 10% tariffs on some U.S. goods to 5%; other tariffs will fall to 2.5% from 5%, according to China Daily, which cited a statement from China's Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council. The shift comes three weeks after President Trump signed what the White House calls "Phase 1" of a trade truce with China, in which he agreed to lower some of the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. The deal also calls for China to buy more U.S. goods and services, at a rate of $200 billion over the next two years, compared with 2017 trade levels. China increased tariffs in September, when President Trump's tariffs on more than $100 billion of Chinese imports took effect. Since then, both sides have canceled or cut tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of products.  "To ease economic and trade tensions and expand cooperation, the Chinese side decided to adjust related measures accordingly," an unidentified official from China's Ministry of Finance said Thursday, according to state-run news outlets. The official added, "It is our hope that both sides will work together toward ultimately removing all additional tariffs."

 Two workers at a General Electric plant in 1980. GE is one of many American companies that used to strive for pristine bond ratings but today gets by with a barely passing grade. A company's credit rating is a lot like a person's credit score. The better the score, the more easily—and cheaply—you can borrow money through the debt markets. The highest score a company can get is AAA. The lowest is D. And for many years, companies strove to get that AAA rating. It wasn't just the key to low borrowing rates, it was also a sign of solidity and reliability. And it came with serious bragging rights. Back in the 80s, there were dozens of AAA-rated companies. Today, though, there are just two. Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson. That's it. Most other companies appear to have given up aiming for that AAA gold standard. They don't see the point. In fact, many companies seem quite happy to get a BBB-, which is the lowest rating that many investment companies will tolerate, and just one notch above a 'high-yield' or 'junk' rating. How can this be? How is it that corporations have gotten okay with letting themselves go like this? We talk with Moody's Analytics Chief Capital Markets Economist John Lonski and Bloomberg Credit Reporter Claire Boston about what's changed in the bond market and why companies are content to get a passing grade.

Episode 772: Small Change,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/05/803037185/episode-772-small-change,February 5, 2020, Note: This episode originally ran in 2015. Here is a thing we hear approximately every day: "The world is changing faster than ever before." Robert Gordon doesn't buy it. Gordon is an economist who has spent decades studying technological change and economic growth in America. He argues that, contrary to popular belief, the world is not changing faster than ever before. In fact, it's not even changing as fast as it was 100 years ago. He recently made this argument in a book called The Rise and Fall of American Growth. In the New York Times, Paul Krugman called it a "magisterial combination of deep technological history, vivid portraits of daily life... and careful economic analysis." On today's show, we talk to Gordon. His argument has profound implications for everything from how the next generation will live to whether robots really are about to take our jobs.

 The expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline has seen significant opposition, such as this camp set up by demonstrators in Vancouver, Canada, in 2018. Canada's Federal Court of Appeal has cleared the way for a major expansion to the Trans Mountain Pipeline by ruling against four different challenges from First Nations groups concerned about the environmental impacts of the project. The Trans Mountain expansion, which would add more than 600 miles to the pipeline and increase its capacity from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000, has been mired in controversy and legal battles since Canada's cabinet first approved the project in 2016. The First Nations that sued are disappointed by the court's judgement. "This project will harm our communities, our people, and the jobs our people rely upon in the Vancouver area," Khelsilem, a spokesperson for the Squamish Nation, said in a statement. The Nation said it plans to look into options for appealing the decision and says it's concerned about future pipeline leaks.  The oil and gas industry appears relieved by the decision. Trans Mountain Corporation, the company in charge of the project, said that "after many years of consultation and review we are pleased to be able to continue moving forward and building the Project in respect of communities, and for the benefit of Canadians."  In 2018, the same federal appeals court ruled that the government had not adequately consulted with indigenous peoples before it approved the project, saying it "fell well short of the mark." Tuesday's unanimous ruling from a three-judge panel has now stated that "reasonable and meaningful consultation had taken place." "The evidentiary record shows a genuine effort in ascertaining and taking into account the key concerns of the applicants, considering them, engaging in two-way communication, and considering and sometimes agreeing to accommodations," the judges added. "This was anything but a rubber-stamping process." The court stated that while the government has a duty to consult with indigenous people, that does not mean that indigenous people have the power to veto a project. "The failure to accommodate in any particular way, including by way of abandoning the Project, does not necessarily mean that there has been no meaningful consultation," the judges said.  They stated that the vast majority of indigenous groups who might be impacted by the project – 120 out of 129 – "either support it or do not oppose it." Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has championed the project to expand the pipeline from the oils sands facilities in Alberta to tanks near Vancouver. In 2018, Canada announced that it would spend about $3.5 billion to purchase the existing pipeline, in order to push the project forward. Trudeau has defended the project by saying that profits from the pipeline will be funneled to green energy projects, as NPR reported.  Trudeau has said that transporting the oil to the Pacific Coast would help open up its market to Asia. At the moment, about 96% of Canada's oil exports go to the U.S.  National Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan said in a statement that the consultation process with the indigenous communities "was the most comprehensive consultation ever undertaken for a major product in Canada's history." He said they would continue speaking to indigenous peoples "at each step of the project." As NPR has reported, Alberta's government has supported the pipeline expansion, while British Columbia's has opposed it.  The city of Vancouver said in a statement that it remains opposed to the expansion. "The city remains of the view that the Trans Mountain pipeline project would have significant environmental impacts, including the unacceptable risk of oil spills and increased greenhouse gas emissions related to the project at a time when the world needs to reduce emissions," it said, according to The Toronto Star.  Parties have 60 days to file a legal challenge against Tuesday's decision in Canada's Supreme Court.

 A notice advising all staff and visitors to wear protective masks stands outside the closed Ocean Park in Hong Kong on Monday. Updated at 7:25 p.m. ET Airlines, cruise ships and high-end hotels worldwide are bracing for a sharp downturn in business because of the fast-spreading strain of coronavirus. Fear of the respiratory virus, which has infected more than 28,000 people in over two dozen countries, has brought the lucrative Chinese tourism industry to a screeching halt. Beijing has halted tour groups from leaving China, and countries such as the U.S., Australia and Singapore are denying entry to foreign nationals who have recently been in China. Dozens of airlines have suspended flights to and from China to try to contain the virus known as 2019-nCoV. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says the cancellation of thousands of flights will impact the industry but that it has proven resilient to similar shocks in the past. Both business and leisure travel took a hit during the 2003 outbreak of a similar coronavirus — SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) — but returned to pre-crisis levels within nine months. Meanwhile, thousands of passengers and crew members, have been stranded on two cruise ships because of the coronavirus. Some 3,700 people aboard the Diamond Princess are under quarantine off the coast of Japan after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive. Health officials tested people still on the ship and say results so far show at least 10 of them are infected. Meanwhile, about 1,800 people aboard the second ship, World Dream, are being quarantined at a dock in Hong Kong. A number of cruise lines, such as Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line, have cancelled sailings to and from China or placed restrictions on passengers since the outbreak began. "There are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding this outbreak to calculate the overall impact on the business," Royal Caribbean said in a statement last week. The company, which says it has cancelled eight cruises so far, added, "If these travel restrictions continue for an extended period of time, they could have a material impact on the overall financial performance of the company." The new coronavirus emerged just ahead of Lunar New Year, normally one of China's busiest seasons when hundreds of millions of people are traveling — both in and out of the country. Beijing has imposed lockdowns and quarantines on the hardest-hit areas. The government also extended the holiday, which was to start Jan. 24 and run until Jan. 30, until early February in an effort to limit infections. Chinese tourists account for more than 10 percent of the global tourism industry, says Wolfgang Arlt, founder of the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute, which helps international tour companies do business with Chinese customers. "You can say that approximately one out of every nine international tourists are ... from mainland China," he says. "That's more than any other country". Arlt says this is a far cry from a couple decades ago when Chinese tourists were usually diplomats or athletes. Over the years, Beijing has relaxed strict travel restrictions, and a growing economy in China means more people there have disposable income to travel. Last year, there were roughly 170 million border crossings worldwide by Chinese tourists, Arlt says. The most popular destinations for Chinese visitors are in Asia, places such as Thailand, Hong Kong and Macau. But he says Paris, Sydney and New York City are also favorites. That's helped make China the largest spender in 2018 in international tourism, pumping $277 billion into the travel industry, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. Chris Heywood of NYC & Company, New York City's marketing organization, says the city welcomed more than a million Chinese visitors in 2018. "China is a tremendously important market for New York City," he says. "It represents about $3 billion in total revenue." Heywood says that while there's concern about the potential financial impact from the coronavirus, his organization is in a wait-and-see mode. "We are monitoring the situation very carefully and very closely," he says. "But it's too soon for us to make an assumption on exactly how this is going to affect business in the long term." Arlt says he's optimistic that Chinese tourism will resume after the coronavirus is contained, much like it did after the 2003 SARS outbreak. "That was a somewhat similar story," he says. "For about three months, no Chinese came out of China" but then tourism began to pick up. "What I think also we can expect this time is once this is over, then the Chinese will travel even more." Arlt says his institute estimates that by 2030, 1 out of every 5 international tourists will be Chinese. But that forecast might change, depending on how long it takes to contain the coronavirus.
Macy's Closing 125 Stores, Cutting 2,000 Jobs As Mall Stores Struggle,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/05/803016213/macys-closing-125-stores-cutting-2-000-jobs-as-mall-stores-struggle,February 5, 2020,

 Macy's is cutting 2,000 jobs and closing about 125 stores, such as this one in Seattle, the company announced Tuesday. Macy's is planning to close about 125 underperforming stores over the next three years, about a fifth of the company's retail locations. The department store did not specify which locations it would close, other than saying the stores are in "lower-tier" malls and include 30 stores in 19 states that are already in the process of closing. Macy's said in a statement that it is also cutting 2,000 jobs — about 9% of its corporate workforce — and shuttering offices in Cincinnati and San Francisco to consolidate operations at its New York headquarters.  The company will also close its Tempe, Ariz., customer contact center and consolidate operations in Mason, Ohio, and Clearwater, Fla. But it plans to add tech and website workers to a future facility in Atlanta.  All this is part of a big transformation Macy's hopes will help boost the company amid an exodus of shoppers from malls and traditional department stores, NPR's Alina Selyukh reports. And the rise of online sales over the past decade have hurt many of the nation's largest and oldest department stores. Macy's plans to upgrade 100 stores in 2020 and open new, smaller boutique-style stores outside of malls, called Market by Macy's. Those stores will feature Macy's merchandise, local goods, and food and drink options. The first version is expected to open in Dallas this week.  It's also adding about 60 more lower-priced stores, called Macy's Backstage. They are similar to Nordstrom Rack or Saks Off Fifth.  Macy's estimates the changes will save $1.5 billion by the end of 2022. "We have a clear vision of where Macy's, Inc. and our brands, Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, fit into retail today," Macy's Chairman and CEO Jeff Gennette said in Tuesday's statement. "We will focus our resources on the healthy parts of our business, directly address the unhealthy parts of the business." Gennette said Macy's will also expand its loyalty program to reach new customers and step up personalized online product recommendations. Macy's says 2020 will be a transition year and that it expects net sales to decline because of the store closures.
Graduates Of Historically Black Colleges May Be Paying More For Loans: Watchdog Group,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/05/802904167/watchdog-group-minority-college-graduates-may-pay-higher-interest-rates,February 5, 2020,

 The Student Borrower Protection Center, a watchdog group, says one lender seems to charge higher rates to graduates of historically black colleges. Financial firms may be discriminating against people based on where they went to college, a watchdog group says. In particular, the group found that a lender named Upstart appears to be charging higher interest rates on student loans to graduates of historically black or predominantly Hispanic colleges.  A lot more people are getting loans these days from a new breed of lenders known as fintechs, or financial technology firms. And some of these lenders factor in where loan applicants went to college.  "It really raised some alarm flags," said Kat Welbeck, the civil rights counsel at the nonprofit Student Borrower Protection Center. So her group decided to run a test. It chose a lender called Upstart, in part because it's a fairly prominent fintech that says it considers educational data. And the group was able to easily apply and get loan offers on its website. The group applied for dozens of loans online — posing as a 24-year-old man. It said he lives in New York, works as a financial analyst and makes $50,000 a year. Each time the group applied for a loan, it kept a whole range of factors constant. "The only difference was where he went to school," Welbeck said. It applied as if this fictional borrower went to NYU in New York, many other schools and Howard University — one of the country's most famous historically black colleges and universities. The group found that if the otherwise identical loan applicant went to NYU instead of Howard, there was a striking difference. For a $30,000 personal loan with a five-year term, it found an applicant would pay about $3,500 more in interest and fees if they went to Howard.  "There's no other explanation that we can really come to terms with other than the fact that where this borrower went to school mattered in terms of how Upstart measured their creditworthiness," Welbeck said.  And it apparently mattered quite a bit. The group also found you'd pay more if you went to New Mexico State University-Las Cruces, which has a high percentage of Hispanic students. In a new report, called Educational Redlining, the group says lenders may be discriminating based on where loan applicants went to college. For its part, Upstart, seems to welcome the vigilance. "We definitely appreciate the intent," Upstart CEO Dave Girouard told NPR. A former senior executive at Google, he said he founded Upstart to use technology to make credit more available. Girouard said the company looks way beyond your credit score — it examines more than 1,000 factors. "Our entire mission and the reason we get out of bed every morning is to improve access to affordable credit," Girouard said. "So we are absolutely supportive of the intent that credit shouldn't be biased or unfair in any way."  But Girouard said the test the nonprofit ran doesn't prove that using education as one of those many factors leads to discrimination. Using "hypothetical, contrived applicants for a loan who aren't real people was both anecdotal and not reflective of the real world," he said.  And he said, under the watchful eye of regulators, Upstart has tested for fairness and bias over "millions of applicants." Girouard added, "Our approach to ensuring that our platform isn't biased against anybody is by doing testing regularly, at massive scale."  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently noted that Upstart has reported to the regulator that, compared to traditional lending models, the company "approves 27% more applicants than the traditional model, and yields 16% lower average [interest rates] for approved loans." The company told the CFPB that "this reported expansion of credit access reflected in the results provided occurs across all tested race, ethnicity, and sex segments."  Still, the Student Borrower Protection Center's report raised the eyebrows of some legal experts. Todd Baker, who teaches a course on fintech at Columbia University's Law School, said the traditional credit score approach to lending has its own problems and biases. And some fintech lenders' alternative approaches can help.  "Using alternative data can be highly beneficial, but also has dangers and we need to be very vigilant that we don't recreate some of the problematic practices of the past unintentionally," Baker said.  Christopher Odinet, a law professor at the University of Oklahoma, agreed. He said that when it comes to using more alternative data points to improve the traditional credit scoring systems and make them more inclusive, "I think there is absolutely a right way to do this." Odinet said there's a need for it, too, because there's evidence of inequities in the way young people who don't have much credit history as well as minority groups are served by the traditional approach that relies so much on credit scores.  A lot of this comes down to whether lenders, when they look at education-related data, are truly looking at the individual and not just lumping that person into a group in an unfair way, he said. "For instance, whether or not you worked through college might be indicative of your ability to handle various financial responsibilities, life responsibilities and make you a more creditworthy individual," Odinet said.   But he said that's different than lumping everybody who, say, went to Howard University, into one group. And he worries that when it comes to considering where you went to school, "the use of education-based data in loan underwriting is inevitably going to cause a discriminatory effect." Advocates are increasingly worried that casting such a wide net for data to make decisions introduces biases in new and different ways. Welbeck said her group is pushing for better oversight and more transparency from fintech companies. The nonprofit's report also raised questions about Wells Fargo for offering better interest rates and loan terms for student borrowers at four-year colleges than those who attend two-year community colleges.  "Even with identical credit profiles, community college borrowers would pay a higher price for credit than students at four-year institutions," the report said.  Wells Fargo said in a statement that it disagrees with the study's characterizations. "Wells Fargo has a long standing commitment to providing access to financing for students attending community colleges," the bank said. "We follow responsible lending practices that take into account expected performance outcomes and are confident that our loan programs conform with fair lending expectations and principles."  Girouard, Upstart's CEO, said his company would be willing to meet with the watchdog group to talk about its concerns. "We're always willing to engage with anybody who wants to understand what we're doing," he said.

 Davon Artis holds a pair of Kobe 6 Grinch shoes, released in 2010. The shoes more than doubled in value within hours of Bryant's death. The death of basketball star Kobe Bryant is rippling through the memorabilia market, with buyers and sellers alike storming stores and online markets hoping to snag one last piece of his legacy. The sneaker market spiked particularly quickly. "Pretty much the same day that he passed, everything we had available was just gone," said Candace Gray, a salesperson at Shoe Palace on Melrose Avenue in mid-city Los Angeles. "That following morning we got hit very hard with a lot of people hoping to grab what they could as far as remembrance," she said. But while some shoppers were in it for the sentiment, others were just looking to make a quick buck by flipping the shoes online. On one website, shoes made famous by Bryant began selling for well over double what they were just hours before. Not uncommon, says Robert Digisi at the Wharton School. "When a celebrity dies, whether it be sports, a musician, an actor, an actress, whatever that might be, there is certainly a lot of human sentiment involved and that will spike demand," he said. "And the market isn't necessarily ready for that." That spike can lead to higher prices on a range of items, from jerseys to t-shirts, and posters to trading cards. But Digisi says the spike is just that — prices level out over time. That means both dealers and fans must choose whether to sell now or hold on. Honoring Kobe's memory At secondhand sneaker shop Cool Kicks, also in mid-city, co-owners Adeel Shams and Davon Artis chose to hold onto them. The store stocked several models, released over Bryant's career. Minutes after news of Bryant's death, the two pulled them from the shelves. "We felt like all the resellers would hurry up and come to the store and take all of the items and try to make money off his name and we were opposed to that," Shams said. Artis says they pulled the shoes just in time. "After we took everything off the shelf, everyone wants to come in either looking for an item or they wanna sell an item they have to profit off because [they] see a market that's going increasingly crazy now too," he said. 
                Davon Artis and Adeel Shams show off a pair of Kobe 1 Protro DeMar DeRozan shoes. The shoes are now worth thousands to collectors.

 Davon Artis and Adeel Shams show off a pair of Kobe 1 Protro DeMar DeRozan shoes. The shoes are now worth thousands to collectors. Shams and Artis say they have more than 100 pairs of Kobe Bryant-associated shoes at the shop. Bryant's fanbase in China and Europe made him an international figure. That translates to a world of collectors and fans hoping to get their hands on a dwindling number of relics — now priced out of reach for the average sneakerhead. Shams points to a red pair of Kobe 1 Protros. "We had it reselling at $750, and now that I'm looking at it, the closest shoe in this size is a 9-and-a-half going for $12,000," he said. But Shams and Artis don't plan to sell anytime soon. When they do, they say they'll likely donate their profits to the Mamba on Three fund, which was founded in the wake of Bryant's death by his wife, Vanessa. The two aren't the only ones putting passion over profit. Candace Gray, at Shoe Palace, doesn't just sell Kobe gear: she collects it herself. She doesn't plan to sell her collection of shoes and jerseys either. "They are going to go into glass," she said. "I don't want to have to worry about not having something that my kids can have tangible to be able to explain the magnitude of who Kobe Bryant was."

Germany Has A New Receipt Law — And Bakeries Are Getting Sweet Revenge,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/04/802669731/germany-has-a-new-receipt-law-and-bakeries-are-getting-sweet-revenge,February 4, 2020,

 Doughnuts with a receipt made of fondant were on display last week at a bakery in Moosinning, Germany. These Kassenbon Krapfen — receipt doughnuts — are a reaction to Germany's new receipt law. A new law has taken effect in Germany that requires receipts to be issued at businesses such as restaurants, bakeries, hairdressers, no matter how small the transaction. It's known as Kassengesetz, or "cash register law": a law for protection against the manipulation of digital records. The measure is meant to increase transparency and prevent tax fraud. The idea is to log each transaction in a format that can be reviewed and verified. Many of these businesses — and their customers — have taken umbrage at the new requirement, but none has done so more deliciously than the country's beloved bakeries. In some towns in Bavaria, in southern Germany, some bakeries are incorporating the receipts into the goods themselves. The Bäckerei Ways in Moosinning has begun peddling Kassenbon Krapfen — receipt doughnuts. The pastries are slathered with pink icing and then topped with a receipt made of fondant, tax included. 
                A bakery in Ansbach, Bavaria, encourages customers to drop their receipts in the window last month, a symbol of the bakery's opposition to the law.

 A bakery in Ansbach, Bavaria, encourages customers to drop their receipts in the window last month, a symbol of the bakery's opposition to the law. The Streicher bakery in Grosshabersdorf had the same idea. "Edible and not hazardous waste," baker Roland Streicher told inFranken.de. Despite its verisimilitude, the sugary doppelgänger doesn't count: A regular receipt still has to be generated. Businesses must provide a receipt, but customers aren't obligated to take it. Some bakeries have begun collecting the receipts from customers in a growing pile in the shop window, a visible reminder of displeasure with the new policy. At the Gasthaus Gutenberg restaurant in Karlsruhe, the proprietors took that idea a step further, stringing receipts in a garland crisscrossing the room. There is in fact no requirement to issue paper receipts in particular. Businesses can issue receipts by email or cellphone. But Germany is still a notoriously cash-based society, making those options unpopular. Companies also aren't required to use an electronic recording system (in which case they are not obligated to issue a receipt), but they still need to keep complete and orderly records. 
                Bakers demonstrated against the receipt law in Hanover in November, seeing it as a symbol of increased bureaucratization. The law went into effect last month.

 Bakers demonstrated against the receipt law in Hanover in November, seeing it as a symbol of increased bureaucratization. The law went into effect last month. Many critics of the law point to the huge amounts of waste generated by issuing all those receipts. Receipts are often made of thermal paper coated in chemicals that shouldn't be recycled. A German trade association estimated that all those compulsory receipts will generate enough paper each year to wrap around the world 50 times. So the controversial law could be good for other enterprises, like the small company Ökobon: It makes organic receipt paper.

Problems with a smartphone app designed to report the caucus results ended up delaying an official count. Updated at 10:10 p.m. ET Who won Iowa?  Iowa's Democrats had hoped that a new smartphone app designed to collect the results of its caucuses would let the party get the count out to the public more quickly.  But as of Tuesday afternoon, the state's Democratic Party was still struggling to report the outcome of Monday night's caucuses, blaming the delay on problems with that app. Finally, shortly after 5 p.m., the party began releasing results.  Shortly before releasing the results, Iowa Democratic Party chair Troy Price said Monday night's reporting mishap was "unacceptable" and offered an apology. He reiterated that his priority is the "accuracy and integrity" of the results.  DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement Tuesday evening that the issue "should never happen again." He said the app would not be used during the primary election process and that the vendor "must provide absolute transparent accounting of what went wrong." Shadow Inc., the company that developed the app for the party, apologized for the delay in a series of tweets Tuesday afternoon. "We sincerely regret the delay in the reporting of the results of last night's Iowa caucuses and the uncertainty it has caused to the candidates, their campaigns, and Democratic caucus-goers," the company said.  "As the Iowa Democratic Party has confirmed, the underlying data and collection process via Shadow's mobile caucus app was sound and accurate, but our process to transmit that caucus results data generated via the app to the IDP was not," Shadow added. The company said that it will "apply the lessons learned in the future" and that it has "already corrected the underlying technology issue. We take these issues very seriously, and are committed to improving and evolving to support the Democratic Party's goal of modernizing its election processes." As the Iowa Democratic Party has confirmed, the underlying data and collection process via Shadow’s mobile caucus app was sound and accurate, but our process to transmit that caucus results data generated via the app to the IDP was not. The Iowa Democratic Party said it has determined "with certainty" that "the underlying data" via its new app "was sound." In a statement Tuesday morning, Price said the app was recording data accurately, but "it was reporting out only partial data" because of a "coding issue in the reporting system."  Party staff then turned to entering data manually, which took longer than expected, Price said. Computer experts and caucus chairs said there was not enough training on using the app before Monday's caucuses, which are chaotic enough as it is. "It appears in this case that the app was never really tested in a manner which came close to approximating the real mess of an election," Doug Jones, a computer science professor at the University of Iowa and a former caucus precinct leader, told NPR on Tuesday.  "Caucus chairs, in many cases, apparently were attempting to download and install the app on their phones on caucus night," he said. "That's extraordinarily difficult to do that kind of thing under pressure."

 Des Moines City Councilman and a precinct chair Carl Voss shows the app that was used for caucus results reporting on his smartphone after he unsuccessfully attempted to drop off a caucus results packet from Precinct 55 at the Iowa Democratic Party headquarters on Tuesday in Des Moines, Iowa. A report by NPR and Iowa Public Radio last month raised several concerns about the app. Cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR said the party's decision to withhold the technical details of its app made it hard to have complete confidence in it.  "Drawing the blinds on the process leaves us, in the public, in a position where we can't even assess the competence of the people doing something on our behalf," Jones, the computer science professor, said then. At the time, Price said he was confident in the party's contingency planning.  "If there's a challenge, we'll be ready with a backup and a backup to that backup and a backup to the backup to the backup," Price told NPR. "We are fully prepared to make sure that we can get these results in and get those results in accurately."  And in his statement Tuesday morning, Price said: "We have every indication that our systems were secure and there was not a cybersecurity intrusion. In preparation for the caucuses, our systems were tested by independent cybersecurity consultants." A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity agency said, "At this time, we have no reporting of any malicious cyberactivity. We encourage our election partners to build resilience into their planning and execution procedures, to prepare for issues that may come up during election processes." Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said, "The continuing chaos in Iowa is illustrative of our overall failure to take sufficient steps to protect the integrity of our election systems."   But as NPR and Iowa Public Radio reported in January, there were also concerns about a lag in the adoption of technology in some rural parts of Iowa.  "At least everybody with smartphones is gonna [use the app], I know that," said Gary Gelner, who chairs the Hancock County Democratic Party in north central Iowa. "You'd be surprised how many people up here got the old flip cellphones." The Iowa Democratic Party paid Shadow, the app developer, a total of $63,183.91 in "professional fees" in November and December, according to a campaign finance report filed by the party in January. Shadow's website describes the company this way: "We are campaign and technology veterans who have built and implemented technology at Hillary for America, Obama for America, Google, Kiva, Apple, the AFL-CIO, and the DNC. Our passion is to create a permanent advantage for progressive campaigns and causes through technology." Acronym, an anti-Trump superPAC, confirmed in a tweet that it had invested in Shadow. "We are reading confirmed reports of Shadow's work with the Iowa Democratic Party on Twitter, and we, like everybody else, are eagerly awaiting more information" from the party on what happened, Acronym said in a statement. Here are the facts about @anotheracronym’s relationship to @ShadowIncHQ, an independent company ACRONYM invested in. We don’t have any information beyond the public statements the IDP has put out + like all of you, eagerly await learning what happened and who won the IA caucus. https://t.co/sWohZqZkPe Multiple county chairs blamed the app for the delayed reporting of results.  Holly Christine Brown, the Asian/Pacific Islander caucus chair for the Iowa Democratic Party, said she was only appointed precinct chair last week and first saw the app on Friday evening.  "We were just given access to the app and told, 'Play around in there a little bit,' and that was about as much training as we got," Brown told NPR's Rachel Martin. "We were able to call in and ask questions, but there was no real training on the app."  Brown said the problems with Monday's caucuses will "absolutely" increase calls to change Iowa's system. "People are very upset about how this happened and how this played out," she said. Elesha Gayman, the Scott County Democratic chair, said the app was difficult to use for older and younger people alike. "It was unique; it's not something you can download in the app store," she said. "You actually had to fill out a form. In addition to that, you got a series of PIN numbers. And so, yeah, there was a lot of layers and I think that absolutely mucked it up. Anecdotally, a few of the people I do know who used the app successfully were younger people. But I do know some young people that also had troubles, just so many layers." Marjie Foster, the Democratic chair of Decatur County, said her caucus "had absolutely no glitches with the app. Our app process worked great. Our chair was very well-prepared. He had trained and tested, and he was on target with it. So we had no issues with the app." But the app didn't work for Des Moines County Democratic Party Co-Chairman Tom Courtney.  "Things didn't work out right," said Courtney, who said he tried to call in the results for several hours but couldn't get through because the number was "constantly busy." Instead, Courtney said, he went home and planned to call and report his precinct's results in the morning. "[The Iowa Democratic Party] made it seem like this was going to work fine. They tested it, tested it," he said. "I'm old enough, I was skeptical, the whole thing, but I thought it would be better than it is. There have been problems. Little problems with it, right, all along. Guess I wasn't surprised." Early Tuesday afternoon, Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate said in a statement that the accuracy of the  vote totals "is much more important than the timeliness of releasing the results. I am glad to hear they have a paper trail for their votes, just as we use paper ballots in all official elections in the State of Iowa. I support [the Iowa Democratic Party] while they take their time and conduct checks and balances to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the votes." The Democratic Party in Nevada, another caucus state, pledged Tuesday to avoid the problems Iowa saw.  "NV Dems can confidently say that what happened in the Iowa caucus last night will not happen in Nevada on February 22nd," the party said in a statement. "We will not be employing the same app or vendor used in the Iowa caucus. We had already developed a series of backups and redundant reporting systems, and are currently evaluating the best path forward." NPR's Pam Fessler and Miles Parks contributed to this report.

 The documentary McMillions explores, using both archival footage and recreations, the story of the fraud uncovered within the McDonald's Monopoly game. McMillions premiered on HBO on Monday, February 3rd. Wherever there are gains, there is the risk of ill-gotten gains. Even at the drive-thru.  The McDonald's Monopoly game, featuring both instant-win opportunities and game pieces that could be collected to win prizes in sets, has been run in markets around the world off and on since 1987. It has encouraged people to collect their game pieces from french fry boxes and cups, and even from inside magazines. And, as Jeff Maysh detailed in The Daily Beast in 2018, throughout the 1990s, it was the subject of massive fraud. Now, HBO has a documentary series called McMillions (which they style in some places, but not all, as McMillion$). Told in six parts, it begins with a flashy FBI agent who discovered a Post-It note on his partner's desk about the case and sank his teeth into it, and it widens out to include McDonald's personnel, other investigators, and the people closely and less closely connected to the scheme that saw game pieces directed into the hands of particular conspirators. How did they do it? How did it turn out that, the agent asserts on camera, there were "almost no legitimate winners" of the major prizes for more than 10 years? It takes multiple hours to explain.  McMillion$ is blessed with one of the great tools of an enjoyable documentary: a great cast of characters. The first couple of episodes are anchored by Doug Mathews, the agent who started chasing the fraud with his partner Rick Dent. You may find Mathews delightful, as I did, or you may find him an obnoxious showboat, as some of my correspondents on Twitter did. Both of those positions seem entirely defensible. (Dent very firmly declines to participate in the documentary because he is the opposite of Mathews, who appears to be having a tremendous amount of fun telling the story.) Without giving anything away, practically everyone involved seems to have a larger-than-life personality, at least in the three episodes offered to press.  But what elevates the series above your basic can-you-believe-this whale of a tale is that directors James Lee Hernandez and Brian Lazarte are able to pull back and show the parts of this story that are substantially less whimsical. One woman is originally introduced as an almost comically bad liar, but later given an opportunity to explain how she wound up in this situation. It isn't that hard to understand how she felt it was a relatively minor moral wrong to deprive people of a lucky windfall and grant yourself one instead — that that chance is a "blessing," as one "winner" puts it. And she explains how she, too, was taken advantage of.  Big crime, when nonviolent, can have an element that's sort of funny — audacious, inventive, and doomed to blow up in the faces of the perpetrators. But big criminals often suck in small criminals, and in those stories, you often find desperation and naivete. If the government entices you to do something you'd never have done on your own, that's entrapment; if a criminal entices you to do something you'd never have done on your own, that's your life changed. McMillions does a good job making that turn, almost leveraging its own lightness to make the point.  The first episode is masterful in setting up the FBI agents as heroes: It draws the Jacksonville, Fl. office where the investigation went down as a sleepy destination, an unusually boring place to be part of the FBI. It uses music you might hear in a '70s cop show when important discoveries go down. It focuses on Mathews' desire to go undercover for the fun of it. There's clever use of abrupt silences to bring out the comedy in his high-octane yarn-spinning.  But as the series goes on, it changes shape, which is one of the reasons I wish the whole thing had been available to preview. I'm curious about the ultimate structure of these six episodes, but the first three had my full attention. 
When McDonald's Was A Road To Black Liberation,https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2020/02/04/398793395/when-mcdonalds-was-a-road-to-black-liberation,February 4, 2020, With the distance of time, I can see that my first McDonald's was an unremarkable thing. There were the antagonistically hard plastic seats. The interior lights that seemed meant to shoo you away. The PlayLand with the broken-down carousel that yelped out tinny renditions of John Philip Sousa songs. And of course, there was that smell: maybe a little bleach, but mostly the aroma of cooking french fries that seemed engineered to induce a limbic response. But as it was my first McDonald's, it was the one I imprinted on and to which I would compare all other fast-food establishments forevermore. The store on Broad and Carpenter was a waypoint between my mother's South Philly rowhouse and my grandmother's, which meant that several times a week, my mom had to bat away entreaties from my sister and me when we walked past. So much of my neighborhood has changed since I was a kid — the notorious Martin Luther King projects were razed, public schools were shuttered and once-thriving churches shriveled up — but that McDonald's still sits brightly and defiantly on the corner of Broad and Carpenter. It's almost certainly changed hands in the four decades it's been there, but that McDonald's remains one of my old neighborhood's most enduring institutions. And as I learned recently from Marcia Chatelain's new book, Franchise: The Golden Arches In Black America, the preponderance of Golden Arches in locations like my poor, redlined, black neighborhood was hardly some accident. Chatelain, a historian at Georgetown and host of The Waves podcast at Slate, outlines a forgotten history of the fast-food behemoth's rapid expansion into black America in the post-civil rights world. The Golden Arches in Black America by Marcia Chatelain Hardcover, 336 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? There were the tense, occasionally violent standoffs between the Black Panthers and local franchisees reluctant to contribute to the group's free breakfast program. There was the company's reluctance to extend franchising to black owners in inner-city locations — which dissipated when those stores became uncommonly profitable as they were often in food deserts. For champions of "black capitalism" — which included civil rights leaders and President Richard Nixon — McDonald's franchising was thought to be an avenue for small business development that could economically empower black communities without government intervention. I talked to Chatelain about her book, how McDonald's fitfully transformed itself from a predominantly white, suburban establishment to a decidedly black, urban one, and the ongoing economic, political and public health ramifications of that shift. (Oh. And also: Calvin.) This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. You write that for most of its early years, McDonald's franchises were not officially segregated, but the company's franchisees were allowed to... To use "local custom." And we all know what that means: to make their own determinations about how they were going to do business. So what did that look like?  The McDonald's we know today is really Ray Kroc's McDonald's in the sense that there's franchise locations, there's uniformity in the kind of food you get, and expectations around service and value. So in those early days, McDonald's were largely in suburbs, largely in mostly white areas. And they varied. In the South, there was deep segregation at McDonald's. One of the gems that I found in the archive in researching this book is the activism of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to integrate McDonald's, which I think is amazing because so much of our cultural legacy and history of the civil rights movement on a large scale is about businesses that no longer exist, like Woolworth's or Katz's Drugs or Rexall. McDonald's was also part of that fight, but it's no longer part of that larger memory. Why is that, do you think? I don't know, though I can speculate. McDonald's started to invest in black franchising after 1968, particularly after Martin Luther King's assassination, and there's a way that they've since grafted themselves onto the story of civil rights. You see it when they talk about the entry of black franchises. They say, "In response to the social movements of the day, we started recruiting black franchise owners." And black franchisees themselves really do see themselves as in the shadow of Martin Luther King. But that gets very complicated. My book is about the constraints that black people live under — as consumers, as citizens, as activists, as participants — and the ways that they are trying to fashion themselves around McDonald's in order to keep a focus on the greater good. Marcia Chatelain In a broad sense, I think in the early days, the men who signed up to be part of this franchise experiment were influenced by two very powerful forces: this deep desire to extend the goals of the civil rights movement, and the re-invigoration of black capitalism as a strategy for black liberation and black attainment. Both of these ideas — civil rights and black capitalism — have been with us for a very long time. But after 1968, it was the perfect storm, because there was deep distress about whether or not the goals of King's movement — of integration, of fair housing, of reducing war, of fighting poverty — if these things would ever materialize in a person's lifetime. But you could see a business opening and you could see the federal government providing subsidies for black people to enter things like franchising. I think the pivot towards black business and the embrace of black capitalism wasn't just about wanting to make profits, even though that was a part of it. I think it was to really be a salve for all the pain that people had absorbed in a very short period of time. There were black critics of black capitalism, but there were also very white prominent proponents of it — including Richard Nixon.  Richard Nixon! Not a friend of civil rights, but he supported black capitalism. [Black capitalism] goes by various names throughout the 20th and 21st century, and it's alluring because it makes no demands on whites who do not want integration. It makes very few economic demands on the government. And it allows black people to have an experience close to the self-determination goals of black nationalism, and to embrace the idea of American liberalism, that there are opportunities for people who just work really hard and invest. So it's this perfect — I don't want to call it a narcotic, but it is a drug. It's the perfect way for people to feel like their political needs are being met, because you can view it from all these different angles. And so Nixon's promotion of black capitalism — he even says, "black capitalism in the best sense of the word!" ; "it's black power in the good way!" — [was a way to say] you're going to own this thing and you're going to stay close to it and you're not going to disturb the white enclaves that I'm getting my votes from. And it worked. You write that the entry of black-owned franchises into the McDonald's fold coincided not just with white flight from cities, but also a mass exodus of white-owned businesses, and with those businesses, jobs. So how did black folks from places like Chicago, which had the first black-owned McDonald's franchise, feel about the presence of these new stores? It varied. And that's part of what I wanted to capture: There's nothing inevitable about fast food in black communities, and it was work on someone's part to make it part of the landscape. In cities like Chicago, where the first black McDonald's franchisee opens after April 1968, after Martin Luther King's assassination, [Herman Petty, a former barber recruited by the McDonald's company] inherits a store that's abandoned by a white franchise owner who no longer wants to do business in that community. Petty comes in and people really feel a sense of pride, because something in the community has reopened. Something has been established in a part of the city that was hit hard not only by the King uprising, but by gradual neglect of that community. And black McDonald's in Chicago still slaps, as the kids say. But in other cities, people were more critical. In Cleveland, there were very successful white McDonald's franchises that the community really bumped up against because they felt like white people shouldn't be making that kind of money in their neighborhoods. In cities like Philadelphia, community groups were opposing McDonald's because they didn't like the idea that the city council was deciding what should be in their community — there were all these other resources that they felt they needed. There wasn't a uniform acceptance of McDonald's in those early days. And because of those tensions, I think the McDonald's corporation tried these various ways of ingratiating themselves to black people. In one of our episodes, we profiled this guy named Tom Burrell, who was the person who basically invented what we now call targeted advertising. He was the person who, essentially, taught McDonald's how to sell stuff to black folks. And one example of that was those ads from the 1990s featuring Calvin. MC: Oh my god. Calvin! McDonald's "Calvin" ads ran for several years in the early 1990s, following the titular character as he moved up the ranks at his local  franchise. Calvin, a good kid from the hood, making a positive impact on his community because he got a job at McDonald's and worked his way up the ladder! It's a whole archetype: the person who found a way out of the ghetto through McDonald's. As I was reading your book, I realized that those ads sort of encapsulate all these ideas about the power of McDonald's — and black capitalism more broadly.  Let me tell you about Calvin. I talked to someone who had worked on the Calvin campaign, and part of the impetus for it was the emergence of the critique of fast food as a dead end and an uncool thing for teenagers to do. That's part of why they wanted to create these ads. But if you go to you YouTube and look up the Calvin ad, you'll see something really interesting in the very first one. As they try to set the scene, it's supposed to be the 'hood. They're brownstones — which now are probably like six million dollars — there's a group of young men who are just hanging out in the corner and they try to induce Calvin into being what one might describe as shiftless or menacing. But Calvin's not with that! And he's also is wearing the baggy clothes. So you don't know how to read Calvin. It's like 40 seconds, if that. But in a very short period of time, you can fully understand what this job at McDonald's is keeping Calvin away from. The idea is that it isn't just the job — it's the discipline, it's the military-like order of these kinds of jobs. And that animates so much of how McDonald's communicated with black consumers. There's a whole series of ads that were in magazines like Ebony and Jet and Black Enterprise that don't talk about the food — they just talk about all the jobs that are created, all the scholarships that have been generated through black franchising. McDonald's as a force for good.  McDonald's as a force for good. And my book is about the constraints that black people live under — as consumers, as citizens, as activists, as participants — and the ways that they are trying to fashion themselves around McDonald's in order to keep a focus on the greater good is something that I'm incredibly sympathetic toward. So for all this pushing of the notion — "look, I started as a fry cook and now I own a franchise and I'm a millionaire" — do we know if the people who own McDonald's franchises actually make money?  There are very few people who have been able to really do that, because the amount of capital, the amount of liquid cash that you have to have to own a franchise is really high. In the '70s and 80s, when people who had kind of made it, young executives, African-Americans who are college-educated, who were able to earn well, some of them took risks and went into franchising and were able to make lots of money. But recent lawsuits and recent contentions involving McDonald's and black franchisees have again — like the broader history of black people — exposed how they are still making less money than their white counterparts. The black franchisees feel very much relegated to certain neighborhoods where operating costs are higher, which is cutting into the bottom line. Some of the demands about modernizing McDonald's restaurants have hurt some of these black franchise owners. And I really struggled about writing a book about aggrieved millionaires, but what's so fascinating about race and capitalism is that you can be the big guy or the little guy, but you're still under the thumb of something. So today, yes, you can become very wealthy as a black franchise owner. But part of that wealth is generated by building capacity — not just having one McDonald's store, but having 10 or 20 stores. And that's really hard to do. A large trend from the '90s that continues today is that very wealthy people, who are already well-situated, are able to get 10 or 20 franchises and make it part of their very diversified portfolio of wealth. So a lot of the recent negotiations about expanding franchising has resulted in very wealthy people just having a lot of franchises to themselves. But for the person who is still connected to an inner-city community and everyone knows him or her — that path is still a little more challenging. Do you think McDonald's is in danger of losing its foothold in black neighborhoods?  I think what's happening to McDonald's and black people, broadly defined, is something that started since the '90s: upwardly mobile black people aren't as tethered to the things that McDonald's can provide in the communities where people are really struggling. So, for example, I can afford a lot of different types of foods. I can afford to live in a neighborhood that provides me a lot of options that are walking distance from my home. If I needed to get screened for diabetes, I can go to a doctor. I don't have to wait for health fair to happen at a local McDonald's. When I think about avenues for my children to pay for college, my first thought won't be, "Go work at a McDonald's, try to get that employee scholarship." When you have more choices, you exercise them. And so I think that for communities that are struggling, that relationship hasn't changed that much, even in light of these critiques. But for people who have more mobility and have been groomed in a way in which they are not as afraid to eat in other places, that the way that McDonald's markets stuff doesn't resonate as much with them because they have a broader set of experiences. I also think that it's challenging for black franchisees who have been deeply invested in the franchising system to make the case to a younger generation that this is the family business that you should get into. And so I think the McDonald's corporation has been struggling for the past decade, maybe two decades, because of the rise of fast casual, because of gentrification in some of these neighborhoods that were exclusively black and now there's a new demand. They're just competing in a more crowded field that learned a lot of lessons from them and are doing what they do better.
The Limits Of Nudging: Why Can't California Get People To Take Free Money?,https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/02/04/801341011/the-limits-of-nudging-why-cant-california-get-people-to-take-free-money,February 4, 2020, Editor's note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here. The Earned Income Tax Credit supplements incomes through the tax code, awarding thousands of dollars each year primarily to low-wage workers with kids. But there's a problem: a huge population of eligible workers fails to file their taxes and get the money each year. Several years ago, the state of California established their own state EITC (CalEITC) on top of the federal one. Depending on how many kids they have and how much they earn, a Californian who files for both the state and federal credit can get upwards of $6,000. For the poorest households with kids, those tax credits could almost double their household income. There's a lot of money on the table to help the most at-risk families in the state, and California policymakers have grown concerned about the large number of eligible workers failing to file taxes and claim their credits. In 2018, the state of California and the California Policy Lab, an interdisciplinary think tank of scholars from various University of California schools, started trying to solve this problem, and they commissioned one of the most fascinating experiments in "nudging" we've seen in a while. Nudge Experiments Nudges are simple, low-cost interventions aimed at gently guiding people to make better decisions. For example, making retirement plans the default option when you join a job, which has been shown to significantly increase the likelihood you save more for retirement. The California Policy Lab and its partners decided it would try and nudge workers to claim the EITC by sending them letters and text messages. The solution seemed like a no brainer: inform people how they can get free money, and they'll get that free money! If only it were that simple. The researchers conducted field experiments for two years on over a million Californians. They randomly divided them into treatment groups, which received various types of messages, and a control group, which received no message. "We were trying lots of different ways of reaching people, lots of different messages you could give people, but to try to test what would be most effective," says Jesse Rothstein, a labor economist at UC Berkeley who co-directs the California Policy Lab. The researchers tried to make sure these letters and text messages didn't look like a scam. Below is an example of one letter they sent: "We found a very precise zero effect," says Elizabeth Linos, a behavioral scientist at UC Berkeley who was also behind the study. Many of those who received the messages, she says, did visit the website advertised in the messages to help them sign up for the EITC. But in the end, they didn't fill out the forms to receive their credit. They turned down free money. "We weren't able to increase the rate at which people file for taxes and we weren't able to increase the number of households that claim the EITC," Linos says. This experiment might seem like a gigantic failure for behavioral economics and the theory of nudging. But both researchers believe their findings support the broader idea that people aren't the perfectly calculating, error-free creatures of traditional economic models. They're turning down free money — even after they're informed they can get free money. The researchers don't have a solid answer for why the nudges failed. They believe, however, a big part of the problem has to do with tax forms. "Those of us who file taxes know that it's not so easy to file taxes," Rothstein says. "And so we've gotten people to understand that it's there and to want it. But we haven't really given them the tools that it would take to make it easy for them to claim it." Linos and Rothstein believe our tax system is too complicated, and that we should make claiming the EITC, and filing for taxes more generally, much simpler. Linos says the good news is that other countries provide examples of systems that don't require mind-numbing paperwork to file for taxes or receive government benefits. "In a lot of countries, the government uses information they already have on you to pre-populate your tax forms," she says. In other words, they tell you what you owe. Or are owed. Then you can just look it over and click send. But we're not other countries. We're the USA, where filing for taxes is still stupidly hard. The IRS estimates that about 20 percent of eligible taxpayers fail to file and claim the EITC. Rothstein believes the solution to getting more people signed up for the EITC has to be a mixture of nudging them to sign up and "structural changes that make it easier to file taxes." This could include an expansion of programs aimed at giving people assistance with taxes, including software designed to make filing easier. A dark view of the findings might write off this population as doomed to poverty because of bad decision-making and self-destructive behavior. But psychologist Eldar Shafir and economist Sendhil Mullainathan suggest a more charitable lens, which they call the "psychology of scarcity ." Their research suggests the poor bear a unique cognitive burden that hurts their decision-making. They work long hours. They have higher stress. They're consumed with thinking about paying their rent, getting their kids medical care, and putting food on the table. Shafir and Mullainathan find these stresses lower their "mental bandwidth," and it might help explain why so many low-income Californians are turning down free money. Did you enjoy this newsletter?

 James Mark (center) inside his restaurant Big King, along with cooks (from left) Oscar Lange, Emily Joslyn, Peter Kachmarsky and JC Kuvaszko. Mark employs fewer than 50 people so isn't required to provide health benefits. But it helps with staff retention, he says, and is the right thing to do. Last winter, James Mark was a 2018 James Beard Award finalist. A few months later, both GQ and Bon Appétit magazines ranked Big King, Mark's newest Rhode Island restaurant, as one of the country's best places to eat. But in 2018, the Providence chef and restaurateur spent almost double his personal income on health insurance for his employees: $54,000 to cover a dozen or so people, compared with the $35,000 he paid himself as a salary. Mark spends most of his time at Big King, which he describes as his "small and strange," experimental Asian restaurant in Providence's trendy West Side. The handwritten menu changes daily. At downtown's Dean Hotel, he also runs the small cocktail bar and the no-reservations restaurant North, which serves dishes like smoked shiitake ice cream and crab and fried kabocha with pumpkin miso. Mark employs fewer than 50 people, all told, so he isn't required to provide them health benefits. But he thinks doing so helps with staff retention and is the right thing to do. After all, if a sous-chef needed an emergency appendectomy, the bill for a patient without insurance could be financially devastating. Offering health benefits, he says, is crucial to treating his employees' jobs as "viable, long-term work." That's why Mark, who studied at nearby Johnson & Wales University and trained at restaurants in Providence and New York City, has joined a growing chorus of small-business owners who are supporting "Medicare for All," or some other type of government-sponsored, universal health plan. He says his concern with the way things are right now is not just the financial burden he feels in paying for his employees' benefits, though that's part of it. 
                Trying to navigate a confusing system of health insurance options to offer his employees takes time that Rhode Island chef and restaurateur James Mark says he doesn't have. "I'm running around trying to keep my small business afloat, just trying to do my job," Mark says. "I don't have time to look up different health plans."

 "I could make a lot more money if I didn't have to pay that," he acknowledges. But the greater burden, he says, are the hours of administrative paperwork he has to deal with — and all the confounding choices from insurers. Though he tries to pick a good option, he says, "I have no idea if it's a good [health] plan or a bad plan, in comparison to everything else." Restaurant industry groups have largely opposed the idea of a single-payer system, worrying it would mean tax hikes. But some individual owners are increasingly open to the idea. Big companies can hire benefits consultants and managers who arrange and administer employee insurance. Owners of very small businesses and restaurants might otherwise decide to let employees fend for themselves. (Under the ACA, only employers who have the equivalent of 50 or more full-time workers incur penalties if they don't offer health benefits.) But, after weighing their choices, Mark and some other restaurant owners conclude they would accept higher taxes if the government would take over the task of insuring their workers. As premiums and health costs rise, the broader industry seems to be eyeing the option with a mix of new curiosity and old concerns. The National Restaurant Association, for instance, opposed the Affordable Care Act and other Democratic reform efforts that were less sweeping than the single-payer approach. Today, the trade group doesn't have a specific stance on Medicare for All, though a spokesperson points to concerns about the eventual tax burden its members could face. The National Federation of Independent Business, an advocacy organization that represents small-business owners, raises similar worries about the potential tax hikes. An internal survey of NFIB members showed 75% opposed single-payer, often citing payroll tax increases as their concern. Aaron Frazier, spokesperson for the restaurant association suggests members could get a better health insurance deal by using the organization's association health plan, which is collectively negotiated by the trade group. Those association health plans — a longtime favorite Republican concept — are a cornerstone of the current White House's health policy. But they remain controversial and are often held to less stringent coverage standards than other forms of insurance. They may have caps on coverage spending, for example, and may not cover some of the Affordable Care Act's "essential benefits," such as maternity care and prescription drugs. A middle ground, proposed by many of the Democratic presidential candidates, might be a "public option," a government-run health plan that individuals — or their employers — could pay to join if they didn't like their other options. That approach could "go a long way" toward addressing some of the concerns restaurant owners have, says Linda Blumberg, a health policy fellow at the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. On the 2020 campaign trail, presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren talk about how their plans would replace the current, private insurance system with a single, government-run program. Their proposed systems would eliminate most cost sharing, so patients pay very little out-of-pocket, and would be financed through taxes. Warren, a Massachusetts senator, says she would implement her plan through two legislative steps, while Vermont's Sanders would do so in one. Rather than focusing on these details, Mark and other restaurateurs endorsing this approach emphasize the result: having the government step in and guarantee coverage to everyone. "We would all, everyone involved, be positively affected," argues Daniel Myers, who co-owns Loyal Nine, a cafe by day and restaurant by night, in Cambridge, Mass. Loyal Nine insures about a dozen employees, who must meet a $3,000 deductible before coverage kicks in. Subsidizing employee coverage makes sense, Myers says — good workers who have health insurance are more likely to stay in the job. Take Jen Wittlin, who manages Providence's Dean Bar and has worked on and off with James Mark since 2012. She says having good health insurance is non-negotiable, for her. She was diagnosed and treated for medullary thyroid cancer, and still needs daily medication and regular endocrinology checkups. "I didn't have the option of working somewhere that didn't offer health care," she says. She used to work a full-time gig at the YMCA (in addition to her job at North), in order to have access to the Y's employer-sponsored health care. Signing up for the restaurant's health benefit instead, she says, enabled her to quit that second job. "People are forced to sacrifice their creative abilities and go into corporate positions because those are guaranteed benefits," she says of other people she knows. "To have it paid for! That's the lure of this place." Still, offering insurance can be a big expense for employers. Myers estimates 10% of his payroll goes to health care. His business is too small to bargain with the insurance company. So each year, the price goes up – and how much it goes up can vary. "You're pushed up against a wall," Myers says. "We have no ability to negotiate our prices. They are what they are." Bigger businesses have purchasing power to wrangle a favorable deal with an insurance company. Smaller ones don't, leaving many restaurateurs in a perilous position, says Paul Ginsburg, an economist who directs the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy. It's pressures like these that fuel these restaurateurs' support for Medicare for All, even though the cost and financing of such a plan are still just pencil sketches. Mark says he doubts he would pay more in taxes under Medicare for All than he spends on health care now. Even if he did, he says, it would be a plannable expense. That — and the knowledge that everyone else shares in the burden — would justify the increase, he believes. Still, Richard Wall, who owns Both Ways Café and Catering, in Seattle, has questions. How would Medicare for All's coverage compare with the insurance he currently gets through his wife's employer? He's unsure. And Adam Orman, who co-owns Austin-based L'Oca d'Oro and subsidizes his employees' health care with a direct primary care contract and other additional benefits, worries there would still be "so many layers of bureaucracy." Still, no longer having to deal with the confusing paperwork of the current system, and knowing his employees are covered, "sounds really good," Wall says. Orman calls it "a step in the right direction." The choice between plans and doctors, which is cited as a benefit of the current market-based system, often doesn't seem an asset to small restaurateurs and their workers. Recently, Mark decided to explain to his staff how their insurance works. In response, he got "glazed looks," he says. a "It's a system that's really confusing."

Even The Facts Are Polarized,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/03/802417653/even-the-facts-are-polarized,February 3, 2020, A new study from a team of economists at Harvard looked at just how polarized Americans have become. And as it turns out, that polarization goes beyond political ideologies and extends to the facts themselves. Democrats and Republicans tend to differ sharply in their perception of issues like immigration, inequality, and social mobility. And both groups tend to have views of the world that diverge from reality. Could this stark difference in perception, even on questions that can be easily checked, be contributing to America's increasingly polarized political discourse? Music by Drop Electric.

 Bernard Ebbers built WorldCom into one of the world's largest telecommunications companies, only to see it all end in bankruptcy and federal fraud charges. Former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers, the "telecom cowboy" who spent 13 years in federal prison for his involvement in a notorious $11 billion accounting scandal, died Sunday. He was 78. A federal judge had released Ebbers from prison in December — short of his 25-year sentence for fraud — because his health had deteriorated. A former Mississippi basketball coach who preferred cowboy boots and jeans to suits and ties, Ebbers was one of the most colorful and successful executives to emerge out of the telecommunications revolution. He created a small long-distance company called LDDS and then relentlessly expanded it through a series of debt-fueled mergers and acquisitions.  In 1998, the company, renamed WorldCom, stunned the industry by acquiring MCI, the second-largest U.S. long-distance carrier, for $47 billion. A subsequent attempt to buy the third-largest carrier, Sprint, was blocked by regulators. Ebbers became personally very wealthy, buying hotels, golf courses, a trucking company and a large ranch in Canada. Everything began to unravel in 2000, when MCI WorldCom's stock price fell, during the dotcom bust. It soon emerged that MCI WorldCom had personally lent Ebbers some $400 million to cover loans he'd made against his own shares of stock. A subsequent investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed the company had been disguising operating costs as capital expenses, and Ebbers was fired as CEO in 2002. MCI WorldCom declared bankruptcy and was later acquired by Verizon for $8.5 billion. Former U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, who was hired by a federal bankruptcy court to examine WorldCom's finances, reported that the company engaged in "a smorgasbord of manipulative schemes designed to cook the books to falsely state the earnings and sustain the price of the stock." "There appeared to be a breakdown in all of the checks that were designed to ensure the integrity of the operation, its transparency and its responsiveness to shareholder interest," Thornburgh wrote in his report. Ebbers maintained that he was unaware of the fraud and that it was engineered by Scott Sullivan, the company's chief financial officer.  "I believe that no one will conclude that I engaged in any criminal or fraudulent conduct during my tenure at WorldCom," Ebbers said at a 2002 congressional hearing, where he nevertheless pleaded the Fifth Amendment and declined to answer questions. But a federal jury found Ebbers guilty in 2005 and he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Sullivan, who cooperated with prosecutors, received a five-year sentence.
What's It Like Working At A Chinese-Run 'American Factory'? It's 'Complicated',https://www.npr.org/2020/02/03/802223983/whats-it-like-working-at-a-chinese-run-american-factory-it-s-complicated,February 3, 2020,

 Chinese workers at Fuyao Glass America attend training to learn about American culture. In 2008, GM closed its manufacturing plant in Dayton, Ohio, sending the community into a tailspin. Workers who had been unionized at GM struggled to find jobs that paid close to the wages the plant had paid. "After that GM plant closed, things were so hard for so long," Ohio-based filmmaker Steven Bognar says. "People lost their homes. The jobs you could get were at the Kohl's distribution center or Payless Shoes warehouse distribution center or fast food. People were making $9 an hour." When the Chinese glass manufacturer Fuyao reopened the shuttered GM plant in 2016, the community welcomed the influx of new jobs. But as time went on, enthusiasm waned. Some former GM employees found themselves working longer hours at Fuyao for half the pay. In the Oscar-nominated documentary, American Factory, Bognar and Julia Reichert capture the tensions that exist within the Chinese-owned, Ohio-based plant. This is Reichert's fourth Oscar nomination — her first was in 1978. "In the United States, we fought to have an eight-hour day and have weekends off," she says. "That's pretty much unheard of in industrial work in China. ... If the boss says you have to work six days a week or seven days a week you just do it." Bognar describes the relationship between the company and its American employees as a "complicated" one. People are grateful for the jobs, but the work is tough — especially on the factory floor: "It's hard, it's hot, it's dangerous, and the expectations are very high," he says. "And yet the pay is not what it should be." American Factory won last year's Sundance Award for Directing of a U.S. Documentary. It was the first acquisition for Barack and Michelle Obama's production company, Higher Ground, and is streaming on Netflix. On the difference between wages at the unionized GM plant and at Fuyao Bognar: In the film, Shawnea Rosser, who worked at the old GM plant and now works at Fuyao, she says it varies directly. She says at GM she was making $29 and some cents per hour and at Fuyao she makes $12.84. So that's less than half of what she used to make. She has several children. ... They lost their house because they couldn't they couldn't make the mortgage payments after GM closed. It's a very different world. Here's the crazy thing: In China, it's been a remarkable trajectory. China's on the rise and [so are] people in the film, like Wong He. He is the furnace engineer who has been sent from China to the U.S. He's here for at least two years. He's not going to see his children for two years. But he's been working at Fuyao since he was 19 years old. He is so dedicated to Fuyao, and it's offering him a path to the middle class. He told us he's going to be able to build a house for his family, for his kids back in China, because he's making such good money. Meanwhile, in the States, people like Shawnea, who once had a blue-collar, middle-class life — modest but secure — they have no security anymore, and it's a very different landscape. 
                Directors Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar live 25 minutes from the Fuyao factory in Dayton. Their previous film, The Last Truck, documented the closing of a GM factory in  Moraine, Ohio.

 Directors Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar live 25 minutes from the Fuyao factory in Dayton. Their previous film, The Last Truck, documented the closing of a GM factory in  Moraine, Ohio. On the work culture clash between Chinese and American workers  Reichert: In our work culture, workers expect to be respected. [They] expect to be not told, "Just do this." [The] American worker will respond, "Why?" And, "Maybe I have a better idea." They'll look, the supervisor right in the eye and question them. This does not really happen in China very much. It's just a different work culture where people do what the boss says. ... People [in China] expect to work 12-hour days, six days a week. The Chinese workers we spoke with — we spoke with a lot of them — they're not happy about it. They don't like being away from their kids for most of the year or only seeing them on Sunday. Partly it's because that's what the culture has brought them to. They've lifted millions and millions of people out of poverty in one and a half ... generations. But that has resulted in this really intense work life. ... Chinese workers are proud of their country, they're proud of their company, they're really proud of how China is flourishing in the world. ... The American workers we know, I can't say that they're proud of their company or they feel really behind America, like America is really helping them rise in the world. filmmaker Julia Reichert The American workers we know, I can't say that they're proud of their company or they feel really behind America, like America is really helping them rise in the world. I think we're on a trajectory of less hope, [fewer] possibilities ... as far as working class people. On Fuyao slogans and songs the Chinese workers are accustomed to reciting  Reichert: There's a slogan that is said, which I think so in kind of [encapsulates] capitalism, which is "To stand still is to fall back." ... They chant it every day. Bognar: When one of the American supervisors, when he got home [from the trip to Fuyao headquarters], he tried to get the Americans to line up in that kind of military formation and it just did not go that well. It's like the people who signed up to work in this hot, intense glass factory in the United States, they're making $12.84 an hour and they're not getting paid enough to line up and be regimented like that. On why many American workers at Fuyao wanted to unionize with the United Automobile Workers Reichert: In the plant it was pretty hot. You see there's safety issues. You see there were a lot of injuries. For a long, long time, there was no nurse there. At the old GM plant they had a nurse on duty and a doctor on call at all times — all shifts. They had nothing like that at the Fuyao plant at first. ... Now they do, something like three years into it. Right at the end of our filming, they actually did get a nurse. I think a really big thing was the policies would change, things like the sick leave. Do you need a doctor's note? ... Do you get fired even with a doctor's note? Do you get fired if you have to go to the emergency room or whatever? How many vacation days you would get, what your pay was. People were told when they joined [the company] ... that within a year they would get a raise. And we went around and asked people a year or so later: Did you get your raise yet? And nobody said they did. And now maybe they'd get it three months later, if they really bugged H.R., they'd get it. But those kind of things were just really frustrating, that they had no power. Bognar: From the Chinese perspective, the company was not making a profit as quickly as the Chinese expected it to. They thought the company would be profitable after a year. We heard this again and again. And here we are, like, a year and a half, two years into being an operational facility and it's still not turning a profit. So the Chinese management fires the American leadership and replaces it with Chinese leadership. Supervisors are swapped out from American supervisors to Chinese supervisors, and there's more and more pressure on the American workforce. And that led to growing frustration on the part of the Americans. They felt they were being treated even more roughly because of the because of higher demands for productivity. And it was just getting harder and harder — and so goodwill started really evaporating both directions. On the "union avoidance" campaign Fuyao ran to dissuade workers from unionizing Reichert: They were very highly paid and they were in there from very early on. As soon as there was any whisperings like a T-shirt about the UAW or those meetings going on, immediately the union avoidance company was brought in. Now, I will say this is not a Chinese thing. Pretty much in any facility, be it a distribution center, be it a warehouse, be it a factory — actually be it in a white-collar working place — if there's talk of a union, they're going to bring in one of ... these consulting companies. ... There's hundreds of them all across the country. I think most Americans do not realize that that is behind a lot of the loss of union power, the loss of the strikes. They taught the Chinese management and supervisors to do everything they could to avoid the union. Bognar: Next time you read in the paper like, "Oh, the Volkswagen workers in Tennessee, they rejected the idea of a union." The thing we don't hear about is all the inside closed door campaigning that the companies do. Roberta Shorrock and Seth Kelley produced and edited the audio of this interview.

Super Bowl Ads 2020: Strange, Serious, Smaaht, And So Very Expensive,https://www.npr.org/2020/02/02/802117965/super-bowl-ads-2020-strange-serious-smaaht-and-so-very-expensive,February 2, 2020, This year's Super Bowl commercials were packed with superstar cameos and in-your-face messages — from Ellen DeGeneres speaking up for Amazon's Alexa to an ad about organic farmland. But they had a few unintended messages, too. These were the stories America's largest corporations developed to entertain, inform and sell products on the biggest stage in television – costing as much as $5.6 million per 30 seconds this year. Sometimes, those stories said a lot more than their sponsors may have intended. Consider Kia's spot, featuring Raiders running back Josh Jacobs driving an SUV, imagining what advice he would give his younger self. Jacobs grew up homeless on the streets of Tulsa, Okla.; in the ad, he's watching a young black boy sprint across the broken streets of Tulsa's struggling neighborhoods. "Push yourself to be someone," Jacobs says, "and I promise, someday, you will." It's nice message for a day centered on scarfing snacks and watching football. But for anyone who knows how unlikely it is for a kid to actually become a pro football player, it's also a sobering reminder of how much young people who aren't blessed with NFL-level athletic skills will have to achieve to escape similar circumstances. Here's a look at some other ads that sent double messages, along with some of the more entertaining, provocative and just plain weird commercials aired on the biggest global showcase for TV advertising: Oddest use of vaguely nationalistic language to sell beer: Budweiser's "Typical American" The self-styled "king of beers" offers some championship-level pandering in this ad, which features a gritty-voiced announcer sarcastically noting how "typical Americans" are always showing off their strength — as images of a heroic firefighter in action play across the screen. The ad urges viewers to celebrate the nobility of "typical Americans." But I couldn't help wonder who the narrator was referencing when he said, "they call us 'typical Americans.' " Who exactly is "they?" And why is Budweiser developing brand loyalty by urging "typical Americans" to rise up against this unnamed source of insult? Vaguely nationalistic, condescending and solicitous all at once — hardly a regal combination. Best wishful thinking: Little Caesars' "Best Thing Since Sliced Bread" A customer getting a Little Caesars pizza delivered calls it the "best thing since sliced bread." This sends a company called "Sliced Bread" — led by an increasingly grizzled Rainn Wilson — into a panic, which involves crying jags and chaotic office meetings with one employee riding an ostrich around. (Really.) But anyone who has tasted Little Caesars' takeout pizza knows sliced bread probably doesn't have much to worry about.  Savviest use of a billionaire's pizza money: Michael Bloomberg's campaign ad A Washington Post analysis found that if Bloomberg spent $11 million on his Super Bowl ad, it would impact his net worth like the average American buying a pizza. For that pocket money, Bloomberg crafted a spot focused on his efforts to secure tougher gun laws, featuring the mother of George Kemp Jr. — a young black man who dreamed of playing in the NFL, shot dead after an altercation in 2013. The ad doesn't mention Trump or any Democratic contenders and barely features Bloomberg, who has faced sharp questions over how his stop and frisk policies disproportionately affected people of color while he was mayor of New York. A bold example of buying your way past racial controversy and into the political conversation. Look on the bright side award: Donald Trump's campaign ad The president aired two ads during the Super Bowl; one featured Alice Johnson, a woman whose life sentence Trump commuted after lobbying from Kim Kardashian. The other was a more traditional campaign ad with shots of the military and Trump at his beloved rallies, as complimentary economic statistics displayed on the screen featuring the tagline "Stronger, safer, more prosperous." One ad seemed aimed right at his base supporters, while the other was a rare pitch to those who might not be among his core voters.  Impeachment? What impeachment? Weirdest use of a celebrity, Part 1: Post Malone for Bud Light There were actually two ads created starring the heavily tattooed rapper/songwriter: Fans picked the one that would land in the game. Both took viewers inside Malone's mind as various characters debated his reaction to drinking Bud Light hard seltzer. My fave, which didn't air during the Big Game, shows Malone, who has tats around his eyebrows and eyes, decked out in a white sweater yelling at his spleen in a bar, like an accountant on mescaline. Weirdest use of a celebrity, Part 2: MC Hammer for Cheetos Hammer's head pops out of a rolled-up carpet and a coiled water hose as his signature hit "U Can't Touch This" plays. The joke: A young guy eating new Cheetos popcorn can't touch anything — declining to help somebody move furniture, for example — because his fingers are coated in yellow dust. Why Cheetos would remind us of one of the most annoying elements of its product in a mega-expensive Super Bowl commercial is beyond me. But I'm glad to see Hammer can still squeeze into those genie pants. Best use of a '90s movie to sell a modern product: Jeep's "Groundhog Day" Bill Murray provides one of the best celebrity Super Bowl ad appearances this year, re-creating his 1993 movie Groundhog Day with a twist. This time, he steals the groundhog in a Jeep Gladiator truck, living a new adventure every day thanks to his great car. The scene where Murray is playing a Whack-A-Mole game, assuring the groundhog it's nothing personal, was simply priceless. Best use of a Boston accent since The Departed: Hyundai's Smaaht Paahk The carmaker won the pre-Super Bowl competition for attention with this ad — featured in loads of preview stories about the game's commercials — with Chris Evans, Rachel Dratch and John Krasinski deploying their best Boston patois. They're touting Hyundai's "remote smart park" feature, which guides cars into tight spaces on its own, while lampooning all the cartoonishly thick accents actors take on for roles set in Beantown. (Best of all, the ad has subtitles with words like "caah," "paahk" "smahtypants" and "clickah.")
A Business Owner's View On Brexit,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/31/801715364/a-business-owners-view-on-brexit,January 31, 2020, It's Brexit Day! From 11:00pm (GMT) tonight, after 47 years, the UK will cease to be a member of the European Union. For businesses on both sides of the North Sea and the English channel, the big question is what a trade deal between the UK and Europe will look like. The UK has just under a year to thrash that deal out. Until then, businesses are in limbo.

 General Motors is bringing back the Hummer brand, as a GMC electric pickup. Around the turn of the millennium, General Motors made a decision: Electric cars were out. Giant trucks were a hit. So the company abandoned its pioneering electric vehicle — not just stopping production but pulling cars off the road and crushing them. And it went all-in on the gas-guzzling military-style behemoth called the Hummer. The polarizing vehicle hummed along for a little while, before the recession and skyrocketing gas prices killed it. Now, the Hummer is making a comeback that once would have seemed improbable, even laughable.  GM is reviving the Hummer brand. But this time, it's going to be electric.  GM is announcing the Hummer's resurrection in an ad airing during the Super Bowl this Sunday. The vehicle itself — an electric pickup — will be revealed in May, with production beginning in late 2021.  The Hummer carries a hefty load of cultural baggage, says Marty Padgett, an editor at The Car Connection and the author of Hummer.  The brand — descended from the military Humvee and famously beloved by Arnold Schwarzenegger — was made by AM General in the 1990s, before General Motors acquired the brand in 1999. Production of the GM Hummer ramped up as GM was shutting down its EV1 electric car program.  The company had "no foresight to think that maybe they should also keep their electric car programs alive," Padgett says. In GM's view, "trucks were selling amazingly well and electric cars were nothing more than an experiment." 
                U.S. Army 3rd Infantry Division Scout Humvees — the military vehicles that inspired the civilian Hummers — move deeper into Iraqi territory in 2003.

 U.S. Army 3rd Infantry Division Scout Humvees — the military vehicles that inspired the civilian Hummers — move deeper into Iraqi territory in 2003. Then GM heavily promoted the Hummer and the slightly less-gigantic H2 as America was launching the war in Iraq. "Advertisements for the GM Hummer were appearing in between CNN segments on the invasions," Padgett says. "What other consumer product has launched in such a controversial way, at such a controversial time?" If the rise of the Hummer was a sign of the times, its electric revival is a sign of how times have changed. Americans are, once again, wild for giant trucks and SUVs. But Tesla definitively proved that electric cars are not just an experiment. And — inspired by Tesla — carmakers are making electric vehicles and highlighting performance, not efficiency and eco-friendliness.  "I have this theory that the electric car segment is getting bro-ified," Padgett says. "They're appealing to a very masculine demographic, and they're doing it overtly."  In fact, Schwarzenegger — the epitome of the manly Hummer driver — is an electric vehicle enthusiast who already owns an electric Hummer. It was refitted for him by an Austrian startup.  But the new GM vehicle might look a little different from Schwarzenegger's custom vehicle — we don't know much about the appearance yet. We do know the new Hummer will be a pickup. And it will have a ton of competition.  "There is suddenly going to be a slew of electric trucks, almost as many as ... the full-size trucks that exist right now," says Jessica Caldwell, the head of Industry Analysis at Edmunds. Among them are the Tesla Cybertruck, Ford's F-150 and the startups Rivian, Lordstown Motors and Bollinger.  
                In the early 2000s, General Motors went all-in on the massive Hummers while abandoning its electric vehicle program.

 In the early 2000s, General Motors went all-in on the massive Hummers while abandoning its electric vehicle program. Trucks are tremendously popular. The top three bestselling vehicles in America are pickups. And they're not cheap.  "We think of them as workhorses, kind of that American icon," Caldwell says. "But they're expensive now. The average large truck transacts at almost $50,000." Add premium options and you can easily drop more than $70,000 on a pickup, even without an electric motor. So automakers — who are struggling to make money off smaller cars, particularly electric cars — welcome high-margin pickups as a major moneymaker.  "The whole market is going to electrification," Caldwell says, and automakers like GM "don't want to lose a part of that very lucrative truck business." By putting this new electric pickup in the GMC family and giving it a familiar name, GM is positioning it as a premium pickup, Caldwell says. So while the cost, like much else about the vehicle, has not been announced, expect a hefty price tag — and the possibility that it will make GM a Hummer-sized pile of money. 
Education Dept. Unveils Fix For Student Loan Program's 'Bureaucratic Nightmare',https://www.npr.org/2020/01/31/801367031/education-dept-unveils-fix-for-student-loan-programs-bureaucratic-nightmare,January 31, 2020,

 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., in December. Public servants with student loans were furious, and the U.S. Department of Education heard them. The department revealed Thursday that it will simplify the process for borrowers to apply for an expansion of the troubled Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program. The move comes after a damning Government Accountability Office review, first reported by NPR. In that 2019 review, the federal watchdog found that during the expansion program's first year, the department turned away 99% of applicants. The change — which the department posted to the Federal Register without a news release or other public announcement — will address one of the most alarming revelations in the GAO's review: 71% of denials were essentially due to a paperwork technicality. According to the GAO, more than 38,000 applicants were denied relief under the expansion — known as Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness (TEPSLF) — simply because they hadn't first applied for and been denied PSLF. The department's fix is to consolidate the two programs into one application form so that borrowers applying for TEPSLF will no longer have to first file a separate application for PSLF. In a statement, the department said of the fix: "We believe borrowers will be better served by using a single form for both programs. So the point is to further reduce confusion and to eliminate the need for a borrower who completed the wrong form to complete a new form." "Sometime in the near future, we'll be able to go one step further and actually text the student that information," added Mark Brown, head of the department's student loan office, Federal Student Aid. The fix was widely praised. "We think it's a great move. It responds to our recommendation," said Melissa Emrey-Arras, who led the GAO investigation. "It is just so much simpler from a borrower perspective to have a single application. That way, you know, if you're eligible for the regular Public Service Loan Forgiveness, you can receive it. And if you're not, you can be considered for the Temporary Expanded process. It's like one-stop shopping." In a statement to NPR, the Education Department said: "This is just another action we are taking as part of our commitment to simplifying the program. While we cannot change the fundamental problem of having to administer a program designed to serve only a small fraction of the borrowers, we are doing our best to at least remove unnecessary administrative burden." Congress created the PSLF program in 2007 to encourage promising college graduates to take up public service careers. In return for 10 years of government or not-for-profit work and 120 eligible student loan payments, borrowers were told that the Department of Education would forgive whatever remained of their federal student loans. But the program's requirements are so rigid and were so poorly communicated in those early days that the overwhelming majority of borrowers have, so far, been rejected. In response to an outcry from borrowers and lawmakers, in 2018 Congress set aside $700 million for TEPSLF — to help borrowers who had fulfilled their public service but who were, unbeknownst to them, in the wrong repayment plan. While the program was meant to help thousands of public servants who felt unfairly excluded from PSLF, its burdensome requirement that they first be denied PSLF created what Emrey-Arras calls a "bureaucratic nightmare." "This can be confusing to borrowers," Emrey-Arras told NPR in September. "It doesn't make a lot of sense, from a borrower perspective, as to why you would need to apply for a program that you know you're ineligible for. Yet that's the way the process works." "What sort of Kafkaesque thing are we in here?" Matthew Austin told NPR in September. His wife, Heather, a teacher, had been denied TEPSLF for her federal student loans. The explanation given, Austin said: "because we had not been denied for PSLF." Austin said that the rejection was demoralizing and pushed him and Heather to abandon their hope of loan forgiveness. But after being contacted by NPR, they reapplied one last time. In October, their application for TEPSLF was approved. The Education Department forgave more than $40,000 in outstanding federal student loans and issued the Austins a refund for the extra payments they'd made. It's unclear how many of the original 38,000-plus denied TEPSLF applicants still technically qualify for loan forgiveness, like the Austins, and simply need to reapply. On Thursday, lawmakers welcomed the consolidation of application forms but also warned Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that the department's efforts to improve the PSLF and TEPSLF programs should not stop here. "The department's lack of urgency in helping borrowers navigate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program has left applicants confused, panicked and rightfully frustrated," said Rep. Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat and chairman of the House education committee. "I am relieved that — in response to intense public pressure — the department is finally taking a step toward fixing the PSLF application process. However, this change alone does not satisfy the department's responsibility to faithfully implement the law." When asked how it feels to have more than $40,000 in student loans forgiven, Austin laughed and said it has allowed him and his wife to "turn our eyes forward, because we can stop making payments on colleges from 12 years ago and we can start saving for college 10 years in our kids' future."

White House Moves To Formally Decriminalize Accidentally Killing Birds,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/30/801382383/white-house-moves-to-formally-decriminalize-accidentally-killing-birds,January 30, 2020,

 Companies would no longer face the threat of prosecution for accidentally killing or injuring birds. The Trump administration is proposing a regulatory change to ensure that companies that accidentally kill migratory birds during the course of their operations will no longer face the possibility of criminal prosecution. Wildlife protection groups are decrying the proposal as an attempt to rip the teeth out of a century-old law that protects migratory birds, while industry groups say they have long been hamstrung by the threat of legal action.  "It is important to bring regulatory certainty to the public by clarifying that the criminal scope of the [Migratory Bird Treaty Act] only reaches to conduct intentionally injuring birds,"Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks Rob Wallace said in a statement. He added that the administration will work "to ensure that best practices are followed to minimize unintended harm to birds and their habitats." The proposed rule, which is expected to be published in the Federal Register on Monday, would formalize the administration's existing interpretation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If finalized, it would make it more difficult for future administrations to reverse the policy shift.  In its final weeks, the Obama administration "issued a legal opinion stating that the law does include the incidental killing of birds," as NPR's Laurel Wamsley noted.  But in February 2017, the Trump administration suspended that opinion pending review, and later that year released a legal memo saying it would not criminally prosecute such killings. The administration described the previous penalties for accidentally killing birds — which it said threatened jail time of up to six months and penalties of up to $15,000 per bird killed or injured — as a "sword of Damocles over a host of otherwise lawful and productive actions." Prosecutions for accidentally killing migratory birds are rare, but there have been several noteworthy cases. In 2013, Duke Energy Renewables pleaded guilty over the deaths of 14 golden eagles and 149 other migratory birds. And the law was "partial grounds for a $100 million settlement with BP for birds killed during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill" from 2010, Earthfix's Jes Burns reported for NPR.  Wildlife protection advocates are speaking out against this change. "The rule sends an irresponsible — and legally incorrect — signal to industry that common-sense measures to protect birds like the snowy egret, wood duck and greater sandhill crane are no longer needed," Collin O'Mara, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, said in a statement.  "This radical interpretation of the law has already allowed oil companies to kill birds without repercussions," Center for Western Priorities executive director Jennifer Rokala said in a statement. "Now, the Trump administration wants to make sure extractive industries can continue to kill birds after they leave office." U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., expressed concern that the proposed rule could "allow large companies to get off scot-free when oil spills and other commercial disasters cause the massive loss of bird life." However, industry advocates such as the National Mining Association are applauding the move. "The protection of migratory birds is important, and the statute should be applied as intended: to protect against intentional killing of birds, not to criminalize a broad range of commercial activities causing a significant chilling effect on industry and commerce nationwide, including mining," its CEO Rich Nolan said in a statement.  The Fish and Wildlife Service, which is part of the Department of the Interior, estimates that in the U.S. more than 700 million migratory birds die every year due to hazards caused by industry. The vast majority of those are collisions with building glass.  A comparatively larger hazard to birds is domestic cats – according to Fish and Wildlife, more than 2 billion birds annually are killed by them.   Once posted, the public will have 45 days to comment on the proposal.
Senators To CFPB: Why Are You Still Failing To Protect Student Loan Borrowers?,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/30/801302136/senators-to-cfpb-why-are-you-still-failing-to-protect-student-loan-borrowers,January 30, 2020,

 Democratic senators are demanding that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, led by Kathleen Kraninger, do its job supervising the student loan system. It has been more than two years since the nation's most powerful financial watchdog examined the companies that manage about $1.5 trillion of federal student loans owed by 43 million borrowers. On Thursday, two members of the Senate Banking Committee said they're exasperated with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's continuing failure to pursue mounting problems with the way student loans are handled. "You and your staff have provided a variety of excuses and shifting explanations for the Bureau's failure to fulfill this critical oversight role," Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown and Robert Menendez wrote in a letter, obtained by NPR, to CFPB Director Kathleen Kraninger. Brown is the committee's top Democrat. Last fall, sources told NPR that a turf war between the Department of Education and the CFPB was effectively blocking the bureau from sending examiners into loan servicing companies to look for problems — in particular with a troubled loan forgiveness program for public service workers. The program has been rejecting 99% of people who think they have met the requirements.  In a subsequent hearing, senators cited NPR's reporting and told director Kraninger that her agency had broad powers to conduct such oversight and could go to court to force the issue. Under Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Education Department has told loan servicers not to cooperate with the CFPB where federal student loans are concerned.  "You don't have to follow her lead," Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, told Kraninger, who, like DeVos, was named by President Trump. Kraninger responded at the hearing that she would rather not have an adversarial relationship with the Department of Education. "I have met with Secretary DeVos," she said, "and we are already discussing how to move forward in an effective way to make sure that we're overseeing servicers." But now, several months after that hearing and two years since the CFPB tried to send examiners into loan servicing companies to perform oversight and was rebuffed, there is no sign of any progress on resolving the turf war.  "We are deeply disturbed by your lack of transparency with Congress," the senators wrote in their letter Thursday, which cited NPR's reporting. "But we are even more disturbed by the way you have stood by — and continue to do so — as Secretary DeVos and the Department have obstructed the Bureau from examining federal student loan servicers."  In a statement to NPR last year, Education Department press secretary Angela Morabito said the CFPB's job was to perform "oversight of the private student loan industry." But the vast majority of student loans come from the federal government — roughly $1.5 trillion worth. "The Department of Education is charged with overseeing the federal [student loans]," Morabito said. The senators in their letter urged Kraninger to seek a court order to compel the department to give the bureau access to information it needs to perform proper oversight. And the senators cited several areas of major concern that they say the CFPB should be looking into, including loan servicers "unfairly steering borrowers into forbearance or deferment plans — which are more costly for borrowers but more profitable for servicers — instead of income-based repayment plans." Brown and Menendez also said that tens of thousands of teachers, nurses, service members and other public servants have been denied loan forgiveness. "Yet — even after multiple scathing reports by the Government Accountability Office and the Department of Education's Inspector General — the Bureau is not examining the student loan servicer responsible for administering the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program." The senators also raised concerns about practices that may be violating civil rights laws. The Student Loan Servicing Alliance has told NPR in the past that servicers have an inherently difficult job working with millions of borrowers and navigating very complex loan programs. "It's really complicated," Scott Buchanan, the executive director of group, told NPR last year. "And so I have no doubt that servicers from time to time do make some mistakes and when those get identified that we work to fix them." The CFPB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

FICO Is About To Change Credit Scores. Here's Why It Matters,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/30/800563459/fico-is-about-to-change-credit-scores-should-you-worry,January 30, 2020,

 Roughly 40 million Americans are likely to see their credit scores drop by 20 points or more. An equal number should go up by as much. Your credit score can determine whether you can buy a car, get certain jobs or rent an apartment. It's a big deal. And so is this: Credit scores for many Americans are about to change — even if they don't do anything. The changes will be extensive. About 40 million Americans are likely to see their credit scores drop by 20 points or more, and an equal number should go up by as much, according to Joanne Gaskin, vice president of scores and analytics at FICO, the company at the heart of the credit scoring system. Every five years or so, FICO updates the way it determines credit scores. This time, the biggest change is in how it treats personal loans, Gaskin says.  Personal loans are growing faster than any other consumer debt category; Americans owe more than $300 billion on them. There are all kinds of personal loan offers in the mail, online and on TV. Many promise to lower your interest rate by consolidating credit card debt into a single loan. For the first time, Gaskin says, FICO is breaking out personal loans as a distinct category to determine whether borrowers use them responsibly. Why does that matter? Let's say you pay off all your credit cards with a personal loan. Under the old system, your credit score might go up. But under the new approach, FICO will look back over a period of time — as far as two years — to see whether you've used the loan to reduce your high-interest credit card debt or whether you're using plastic as much as before, running up new revolving balances and falling deeper into debt. "What we find is that potentially that consumer's credit file carries more risk than what was apparent," Gaskin says.  If your finances are in good shape and you already have a good credit score, you're likely to see your score improve, she says. But Gaskin says those whose scores will decline are typically people in the lower FICO score range, about 580 and below. (FICO scores range from 300 to 850.) That's not good news for people who are struggling financially, says Marisabel Torres with the Center for Responsible Lending. "It sounds like we're penalizing people for getting into a bad situation." Torres says people who already have low scores are most likely to see their scores go even lower — and that will worsen inequities in the credit system. With personal loans, people with good credit can qualify for good terms. But Torres says predatory lenders charge people with lower incomes very high interest rates.  "A lot of the predatory products concentrate these offers in lower-income neighborhoods, targeting communities of color especially who tend to have the more limited options for financing and for credit," Torres says. "They end up getting ensnared and into this cyclical debt." She says it doesn't seem fair that now, on top of that, many will be getting hit with a lower credit score than they would have before. With some loans, especially home mortgages, lenders tend to use older versions of the FICO score, so the new version won't have an impact on all types of lending. Gaskin says the goal with FICO's newest score is to give lenders better information so they can extend credit to more borrowers at better rates. While you can't control the way the scoring system works, there are steps you can take to improve your creditworthiness. "Don't make late payments on a regular basis," says Sara Rathner of the personal finance site NerdWallet. "Pay all of your debt obligations on time every month. That's huge."  Rathner says one thing a lot of people don't realize is that it's often unwise to close older credit card accounts. "So many people think about 'cleaning up their credit' as as like Marie Kondo-ing their wallet," she says.  But Rathner notes that when it comes to credit cards, it can help to hold on to older accounts for a long time. Doing that gives consumers a more established credit history. If an older card is charging you an annual fee, Rathner says, you can often get the issuer to switch to a card with no fee, while still keeping the extended credit history intact.  She offers another tip: Don't use more than a third of your available credit on all your credit cards. If you exceed that threshold, it can hurt your credit score.

 Consumer spending continues to be a main driver of economic growth, although consumers were a little more cautious in the final months of 2019. Updated at 10:05 a.m. ET  The U.S. economy grew 2.3% last year, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That's a slowdown from the previous year, when the economy grew 2.9%. And it's well short of the 3% growth target set by the White House. In the fourth quarter, the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.1%, matching the pace of the previous three months. The Congressional Budget Office is projecting GDP growth of 2.2% this year. "We anticipate that consumer spending, spurred by rising wages and household wealth, will remain strong," CBO Director Phillip Swagel told a House committee on Wednesday. "We also expect business investment to rebound as several of the factors that weighed on businesses last year abate." Swagel's forecasts for the rest of the decade are less rosy, with annual GDP growth slumping to an average of just 1.7%.  "That growth rate is lower than the historical average because of long-term demographic trends," Swagel said. "The United States is an aging society. That means the growth of our labor force will be slower in the future than it has been in the past."  The Trump administration has tried to lure more people into the workforce with a combination of carrots and sticks. The carrots include tax cuts that increase take-home pay.  The sticks include work requirements and other adjustments to safety-net programs such as food stamps.  A strong job market has drawn more people off the sidelines into the workforce. Labor force participation has climbed from a low of 62.4% in 2015 to 63.2% today, although rates in the U.S. still lag those in other countries.  "I think we've learned quite a lot of good things about the labor market," Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday. "Good things suggesting that there's been more room to run." Powell said newly signed trade pacts with China, Canada and Mexico could give businesses more confidence to invest in the new year. Lackluster business spending was a drag on growth for much of 2019. However, Powell cautioned that uncertainty surrounding trade policy has not gone away. "There's a bit of a wait and see attitude," the Fed chairman said. Consumer spending continues to be a main driver of economic growth, although consumers were a little more cautious in the final months of 2019. The housing market is also rebounding, thanks in part to low interest rates.

 Two European Commission officials, Thierry Breton (left) and Margrethe Vestager (right), give a press conference on 5G security Wednesday in Brussels. The EU recommended that member states screen telecom firms, but did not call for banning any by name. The Chinese telecom Huawei said it welcomed the decision and hopes to take part in building 5G networks in Europe. When it comes to U.S. national security, one foreign company sets off alarm bells like no other: Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant. Huawei scored a key victory, and the U.S. suffered a significant setback, when the company received the green light to build up to 35% of Britain's 5G cellular phone network. "This is a major loss for American national security, foreign policy and technology policy," said Peter Singer of the New America think tank in Washington. The Trump administration has lobbied hard with U.S. allies, urging them not to buy from Chinese firms. "It's critical that European countries not give control of their critical infrastructure to Chinese tech giants," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote last month in an op-ed for Politico. "Just consider Huawei's track record. ... It is implicated in espionage in the Czech Republic, Poland and the Netherlands, [and] has allegedly stolen intellectual property from foreign competitors in Germany, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States. David Edelman was on the National Security Council under President Obama and now runs MIT's Internet Policy Research Initiative. He puts it this way: "The administration's case goes like this. They say first that Huawei equipment is generally less secure than its competitors. Second, that Chinese security services might find it irresistible to try to steal secrets. Third, and maybe most dramatically, if there were ever a major conflict, Beijing might use that access to remotely shut down critical systems." Britain says it decision is based in part on working with Huawei for years on its existing cellular system. Britain also believes it can manage the risk by limiting Huawei to the periphery of the new network — things like base stations and antennas that mostly pass on data — and keeping it away from the more sensitive network core. This 5G network hasn't yet been built, and the U.S. hasn't yet given up making its case. Pompeo was in Britain on Wednesday and said he would continue to stress U.S. security concerns. "The real question here is whether we've crossed a particular Rubicon, whether by having this Chinese content in the underlying 5G network, that effectively it's a decision that can't be reversed," Edelman said. Which brings us to the second big issue — the global technology competition. For many in the West, China is viewed as a giant factory that puts together iPhones. But the latest development means it's now been cleared to help build a cutting-edge network in Western Europe. 5G is being billed as revolutionary. Data will move a lightning speed, driverless cars will communicate with each other, doctors will perform surgery remotely. And China is now considered at the forefront. "China is today a major player in the technology market," said Beau Woods, who studies cyber issues at the Atlantic Council in Washington. The British decision, he added, "is a big win for China's prestige and also kind of puts other nations, other companies, on notice that China's not just the packaging and assembly hub of the world anymore." China's stated goal is to be a world leader in the most important technologies of the 21st century. To this end, the government supports Huawei and other tech companies in ways that Western countries don't, said Dean Cheng with the Heritage Foundation. When it comes to 5G, he said, Huawei offers the complete package, something Western firms can't match at this point. "They offer essentially soup to nuts," Cheng said. "That's a huge advantage in terms of the whole system being integrated. It presumably works well with each other. Also, it is significantly cheaper than any of the partial competitors out there." All this makes it harder on the third big issue — U.S. foreign policy. The Trump administration has pressed American allies to keep Chinese hardware out of their sensitive networks. The results have been mixed at best. "If you're not getting your closest intelligence partners on board, how can you expect to get the rest of Europe or Latin America, Africa?" Peter Singer asked. "The thing to watch for is the dominoes falling. All the other states that have been holding back, may be saying, 'OK, the Brits are going this way now. We can, too.'" Just a day after the British decision, the European Union on Wednesday recommended limiting, but not banning, "high-risk" companies. Huawei said it welcomed the decision and hopes to be part of a fast, secure 5G network across Europe. Greg Myre is an NPR national security correspondent. Follow him @gregmyre1.

 Updated at 8:20 p.m. ET Starbucks has temporarily closed more than half of its stores in mainland China as an outbreak of coronavirus has surged through the country, affecting thousands of people.  Starbucks executives on Tuesday called the viral outbreak a "very complex situation," adding that the company closed its locations in China at the direction of local government officials as well as "proactively," to limit the spread of the virus among workers and customers.  "Our immediate focus is on two key priorities in China," CEO Kevin Johnson told analysts on an earnings call. "First, caring for the health and well-being of our partners and customers in our stores. Second: playing a constructive role in supporting local health officials and government leaders as they work to contain the coronavirus." China is a key, fast-growing market for Starbucks and many other companies that are starting to see an impact from the outbreak and the measures that Chinese authorities have imposed in response, including a lockdown of multiple cities with tens of millions of residents.  Other chains such as McDonald's and KFC have also been closing stores. McDonald's is expected to share an update on Wednesday when it reports its quarterly earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said on Tuesday that his company has closed one of its retail stores.  "Many of the stores that remain open have also reduced operating hours," Cook said. "We're taking additional precautions and frequently deep-cleaning our stores as well as conducting temperature checks for employees." Starbucks CEO Johnson said he had anticipated raising the company's financial forecast for the year on Tuesday, but would not do so now "due to the dynamic situation unfolding with the coronavirus." China is the second-largest market for Starbucks, which had almost 4,300 stores there at the end of 2019.  In a company earnings release on Tuesday, Starbucks said "Currently, we have closed more than half of our stores in China and continue to monitor and modify the operating hours of all of our stores in the market in response to the outbreak of the coronavirus."  Chinese authorities say that a surge in cases of the rapidly spreading coronavirus in recent weeks has sickened nearly 6,000 people as of Wednesday, with more than 130 deaths. Additional cases have been reported outside of China, including in Australia, France and Canada and the U.S. In the United States, five confirmed cases involve people who recently traveled to Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. At a news conference Tuesday, top U.S. health officials reiterated that the disease — while serious — is not currently a threat to ordinary Americans. NPR's Shannon Bond and Richard Harris contributed to this report.

 Lynne makes an Amazon Flex delivery in Worcester, MA. If you buy a lot of stuff on Amazon, you're probably used to seeing that smiley, brown box by your door when you get home. But have you ever thought about the person who put it there? As it turns out, Amazon delivers nearly 50 percent of its own packages, and many of those drop-offs are made by gig workers the company hires through an app called Amazon Flex. Workers get some flexibility to choose their own hours and even the wages they work for. But because they're hired as independent contractors, they don't get the kinds of benefits regular employees receive. On today's show, we deliver packages with an Amazon Flex worker, and we explore the trade-offs that come when a gig replaces a job. Music by Drop Electric. Find us: Twitter / Facebook / Newsletter.

 Travelers wait at the ride-share pickup location at Sacramento International Airport. Uber is allowing drivers at three California airports to set their own fares. Uber is testing a new feature in California that allows some drivers to set their own rates. The move comes in response to a new state law that requires more companies to convert their contract workers to employees, which means offering them benefits and added protections. Companies including Uber, Lyft and delivery app Postmates argue that doing so would upend their business model and eliminate the flexibility inherent to the gig economy. Uber is currently testing a feature at airports in Sacramento, Palm Springs and Santa Barbara that allows drivers to increase fares in 10% increments, up to five times the base rate. Riders are then matched with the lowest fare. In the coming days, Uber says it will also allow drivers to decrease their prices below the base rate and opt out of surge pricing. It's part of an effort to give drivers more control — and bolster the argument that they're truly contractors rather than employees.  The company acknowledges the experiment could have unexpected consequences.  "It could create more volatility for riders who expect a level of consistency in prices that could change as a result of this," said Daniel Danker, head of driver product at Uber. "And this does add some meaningful complexity to the driver's experience that gives them even more control on how their earnings work."  Driver and rider confusion Nar Bustamante, a traveler at Sacramento International Airport returning from Las Vegas, said he read about the new pricing experiment before landing.  "I think it opens up the road to many misinterpretations between rider and driver," he said. "I don't really know what the normal rate is. It didn't say: 'Here's what the normal rate would be.' So, I'm curious to see where this particular ride ends up."  Drivers in Sacramento appear to be split on the new feature.  Adnan Badaoui, who has been driving for Uber for four years, began using it last week. He says even a small rate increase can add up for drivers. "It's not that much difference my friend, but it makes a difference to us, as a driver," he said. But driver Kim Beaver hasn't had much luck. When the feature launched, she set her fare 50% higher than the base rate and waited for an hour without any activity.  "It's just going to be chaos and frustrating for people," Beaver said. "You'll be waiting an hour to two hours to God knows how long." Gig companies continue to negotiate with state officials, seeking relief from the new labor law that requires companies to convert many contract workers to employees.     But Francis J. Mootz III, professor of law at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, says efforts like Uber's new pricing feature may not be enough to convince lawmakers.  "Two or three years ago, if Uber and Lyft and other ride-share companies had really tried to restructure in a way to give workers true independence, true entrepreneurial opportunities, it might've been different," Mootz said.

 Amid impeachment and the 2020 election, surveys show political fevers running high at work, undercutting trust and productivity. And workers and employers are bracing for those dynamics to get worse. A few months ago, a skirmish broke out on the factory floor of a clothing maker in Portland, Ore. It had received an order to make T-shirts for the Trump presidential campaign — but some people refused to work on the project. The conscientious objectors were allowed to opt out, says Darcey McAllister, who handles human resources for her small- and medium-size business clients. "But then those same people were harassing the people who were actually working on the project," she says. "'And so the manager called me and was like, 'What do I do?' " McAllister told him to remind protesting workers that there was a business to run and to stop heckling their coworkers. On factory floors and work sites and in clusters of cubicles, political divisions are playing out as real-life work drama. Such disputes are not only more common, but they're also more contentious, especially amid an impeachment trial and the lead-up to the November presidential election.  According to a recent survey by the Society for Human Resource Management, 42% of U.S. workers have had political disagreements at work. And the resulting strife feeds an undercurrent of workplace stress.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Employees can't focus, the pace of work slows, and trust is broken. Some workers feel unwelcome or even discriminated against. That's especially true if they're in the political minority in their workplace.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. "The people who are Trump supporters probably keep a low profile for fear that they will get verbally attacked or questioned to the point that it would make them feel uncomfortable," McAllister says. "I do absolutely have that sense that that's true in Portland." What's more, she expects it to get worse: "I know as we get closer to November 2020, it's going to become more and more of a problem."

 That leaves people like Beth Kloetzer in a bind. Kloetzer supervises a Wilmington, Del., library — typically a quiet environment for reading or researching in peace. The 30-person staff is supposed to offer unbiased help finding information. "We're like Switzerland; you know, we're neutral," Kloetzer says.  Except that has not been the reality. Personal politics have redrawn allegiances and roiled tensions among staff members. Kloetzer — a Democrat — says, at times, it's difficult to avoid getting sucked into talking about the political events of the day, at work and online.  "Actually, I have a colleague that I just block her on social media because I was like, 'I can't see this,' " Kloetzer says. She blocks angry posts from her news feed from both sides. Such comments reveal her coworkers' political leanings, which range from conservative Trump supporters to nonsupporters, to liberals and a few in between.  "I wonder sometimes: Do people feel this strongly or is it just that they're driven to feel that way because that's the mood?" Kloetzer says. It has calmed down a bit recently, she says, perhaps because she has urged her staff to read memoirs written by people on opposing sides, including Hillbilly Elegy, by conservative author J.D. Vance, and Born a Crime, by liberal comedian Trevor Noah.  "Reading about people of different views, you grab hold of the things that you can relate to," Kloetzer says. "It might not change your opinion overall, but it might give you a greater understanding of why everyone doesn't agree." Some, like Brian Melehan, seek refuge in silence. Politics feels so personal these days he worries a slip of the tongue could cost him business. "I don't want to make anybody mad; it makes me kind of walk on eggshells," he says. Melehan's family runs a residential construction firm in Lisle, Ill. He describes his views as to the left of the Republican-leaning majority in his community. Politics was once safe fodder for chitchat, he says, but now he avoids the subject altogether — especially with clients. That never used to be the case. "I never, ever felt like I was in fear that my political viewpoint would somehow prevent people from wanting to hire me because they don't like what I think," he says. Melehan says he thinks healthy debate is necessary for democracy and hopes tensions will eventually ease. "Division sells," he says. "It is something that people can get behind for a brief period of time, but eventually we all have to work with each other."

 A helicopter flies in Brazil in 2014. Some helicopter trips — like personal or private helicopter rides — are more likely than others to end in a fatal accident. For the vast majority of Americans, helicopters are hardly a routine form of transportation. But a high-profile helicopter disaster — like the crash in Calabasas, Calif., that killed Kobe Bryant and eight other people on Sunday — can draw widespread attention to helicopter safety. Helicopter rides are significantly riskier than commercial airline flights, but not as dangerous as a trip on a personal plane. And some trips — like personal or private helicopter rides — are far more likely than others to end in a fatal accident. "I think it is natural to the public, whenever an accident happens, to start to question the overall safety of a certain type of flying," says Anthony Brickhouse, a professor of aerospace and occupational safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. "I would just caution people to be patient and to let the investigation play out so that we can figure out what happened." Commercial plane travel is extremely safe, despite recent catastrophes like the Boeing 737 Max crashes; in many years the fatal accident rate in the U.S. is zero. Helicopters are more dangerous, according to data from the federal government, with a fatal accident rate of 0.72 per 100,000 flight hours in 2018.  But general aviation — like recreational flying — is even more dangerous than that, with a fatal accident rate of more than 1 accident per 100,000 flight hours in 2018.  In general, helicopters today are safer than they used to be: Over the past two decades, the fatal accident rate has dropped by half, according to the United States Helicopter Safety Team, or USHST, an alliance of government and industry representatives.  But the past few years have seen mixed results. The fatal accident rate rose in 2017 and 2018 before dropping slightly last year. Some helicopter rides are far riskier than others. In the U.S., sightseeing tours, police and news trips, and aerial observation flights tend to be safer than other flights, the USHST says. Corporate flights and "air taxi" flights are in the middle of the pack.  And personal or private helicopter flights are responsible for a disproportionate number of fatal helicopter accidents. Personal or private rides account for just 3% of flight hours but more than a quarter of fatal accidents.  To make helicopter flights safer, the USHST urges changes in training and technology. It also urges pilots to avoid flying too low. The group also highlights the risk of "get-there-itis," when pilots are so determined to arrive at a destination that they ignore signs of risk. In some cases a powerful passenger can also put pressure on a pilot to complete a trip in unsafe conditions, pilots say. Bob Clifford, a lawyer who has worked in aviation litigation for decades, says helicopters offer little margin for error, and when disasters do occur, they are often catastrophic.  "When they work they're wonderful," Clifford says. "Incredible convenience, incredible experience. But the flaws, if there are any in flight, are very fatal."  But Brickhouse, the aerospace professor, says there are a number of ways that helicopter flights can go wrong without ending in disaster. In the event of an engine failure, for instance, a technique called autorotation can bring an aircraft down safely. "It's not like you have an issue with the helicopter and because it's a helicopter, it's just going to fall out of the sky and everybody's going to perish," he says. "It's really not that simple." There's another question that sometimes pops up after high-profile crashes: How does the risk of flying compare to the hazards of the road?  It's an oft-repeated fact that commercial air travel is much safer than driving. That's not necessarily the case for helicopters — but the crash rates for helicopters and cars are calculated differently, so it's hard to make a precise comparison. But one thing is for sure: Americans spend far more time in their cars — some 70 billion hours a year, according to AAA — and as a result, are much more likely to die in a car crash than any other form of transportation.

 DeWitt Clinton pours water from Lake Erie into the Atlantic Ocean after completion of the Erie Canal. In 1809, representatives from the state of New York traveled to the nation's capital to meet with President Thomas Jefferson. They wanted money for a 363-mile canal that would link Lake Erie with the Hudson River, thereby opening up New York City to a funnel of commerce from the developing American West. In an age before bulldozers and chainsaws, building an artificial waterway through untamed wilderness, mountains and rocky cliffs was audacious. Jefferson had come to office promising federal spending on infrastructure, so canal supporters had a reason to believe he would pony up. He did not. He declared that the proposal for the Erie Canal was a "little short of madness."  But did that stop New York from building it? No! New York decided to go it solo. The state issued bonds and had private investors lend it money for the canal. And in only eight years — with zero financial support from the federal government — New York finished the canal with uproarious celebrations. In October 1825, Dewitt Clinton, the New York governor who had fought for the canal as naysayers called it "Clinton's ditch," boarded a boat at Lake Erie with two kegs of lake water. And 10 days later, he poured the water into the Atlantic Ocean after reaching New York City.   The Erie Canal was an immediate success. It unleashed a flood of resources from the West, dramatically increasing the variety of products and slashing consumer prices. New York manufacturers got increased access to markets in the expanding frontier, and New York became the central seaport for global commerce to reach America's heartland. Almost instantly, toll revenue from the canal was nearly five times more than the interest due from the state's bond debt. By 1837, only about a decade after completion, the entire debt was paid off. By the early 1850s, the canal carried over 60% of total U.S. trade.   So what about now? Despite decades of bipartisan calls for more federal investment in infrastructure, federal spending on it has fallen in half over the last 35 years (from about 1% of GDP to 0.5%). It's why local leaders often blame the federal government for their infrastructure problems. But the Erie Canal is a testament to the fact that they don't necessarily need the federal government to pursue big projects.  State and local governments currently pay for more than three-quarters of all U.S. infrastructure spending. "While the federal government has effectively been stuck in neutral, we've seen states and localities pick up the slack by, in fact, going to the private markets, much like their predecessors did in New York state with the Erie Canal," says Adie Tomer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program. The municipal bond market alone, he says, is roughly $4 trillion, and much of that is for infrastructure.  But like federal spending, state and local spending has also declined over the last decade. That's despite an 11% increase in the amount spent on repairs. "For the most part, public infrastructure investment has shifted to upkeep, on what we've already built," Tomer says.  Tomer believes the shift to operation and maintenance — as opposed to transformative megaprojects like the Erie Canal — "is perfectly symbolic of the population and economic era the United States is in." Population and economic growth, for the most part, has stagnated.  The decline in shiny, new infrastructure projects is also the result of the types of technologies coming online. Many, such as electric and autonomous vehicles or digital platform systems that improve traffic, simply build on existing infrastructure.  "It's in our DNA in the United States — whether it's the Erie Canal or the transcontinental railroad or the interstate highway system — to want a megaproject," Tomer says. "The question today is what actually is a megaproject for this new era."  While there's broad agreement that we need more investment in infrastructure, there is not broad agreement on what kind. The left wants a Green New Deal that will liberate the United States from fossil fuels and mitigate the effects of climate change, and much of that would involve big changes in infrastructure, from massive investment in high-speed rail to a more efficient electrical grid. Some megaprojects are in the works, including a new railway connecting Miami and Orlando, Fla. — but so far the sexiest ones have stalled. Take, for instance, the proposed bullet train between San Francisco and Los Angeles. It's a fiasco. It has received billions of dollars in both state and federal funding, yet — in more time than it took to build the entire Erie Canal — there has barely been any progress. By the end of the 19th century, railroads replaced canals as the primary carrier of goods around the country. But historians agree that the canal helped New York grow to become the powerhouse it remains today. More broadly, it jump-started American industrialization and globalization.

 Security experts are urging U.S. political candidates to focus more on cybersecurity to avoid embarrassing or damaging hacks. Paranoia is the best strategy for political campaigns when it comes to digital security. After all, who can forget the massive hack of the Hillary Clinton campaign's emails during the last presidential election and its embarrassing consequences? The reelection campaign of Maine Sen. Angus King took this to heart. Lisa Kaplan, King's digital director, regularly sent out fake emails to her staff to "see who would click on them." Those emails during the 2018 campaign looked real — but they were not. The goal was to keep staff members on their toes so they wouldn't fall for emails from real hackers intent on damaging the campaign. "We would try to get them to do things like change their password for their email or change their password for the database we were using," Kaplan said. It's this kind of attention to detail and seriousness about security that political veterans and party officials are urging on candidates and their staffs. Starting next week, the first votes in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries will be cast. Even more campaigns — from congressional races to local contests for mayor and city council — are gearing up for November's election. Communication is the lifeblood of any political campaign, but it can also be the thing that sinks it if messages get hacked or manipulated. Email and social media accounts can be taken over. Sensitive or embarrassing documents can be leaked, and false information can really damage a campaign. Campaigns are especially vulnerable because they operate like startups: They're created from the ground up and add staff quickly. People move in and out of jobs quickly and bring in new phones and laptops. "Campaigns are effectively startups, but their risk profile is more like established large businesses," said Mark Risher, who works on account security at Google. Additional risk comes from staffers using personal cellphones, computers and email accounts to work on sensitive material. That rapid, often chaotic growth creates openings for hackers. "You have almost every worst-case scenario," said Mary Dickinson, a co-founder of U.S. CyberDome, a nonprofit offering free cybersecurity services to campaigns. "You can't really do effective training because you've got people coming on board all the time," she said. And since it's normal for people to bring their own devices into the campaigns, "you've got used devices that are not scrubbed being brought into the food chain," Dickinson said. The most infamous hack of a campaign happened in 2016, when Russians broke into the Gmail account of Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta. Some of the emails were embarrassing, such as Clinton's paid speeches to Wall Street banks. The Russians got into Podesta's email account through a phishing attack — where hackers send emails disguised to look like they're from a familiar sender or from a known entity like a bank. They try to trick people into handing over passwords. Phishing is "very, very cheap to perpetrate [and] very, very easy to scale," Risher said. "The attackers get to keep trying again and again until they succeed, and the target only has to make a mistake once." Nearly four years after the Clinton campaign email hack, phishing attacks haven't changed much, Risher said. "The attackers are still mostly using the same techniques that were effective in 2016, 2017, 2018. They haven't evolved because they haven't needed to," he said. Despite ample evidence that political figures are targets, they remain vulnerable. A recent national survey by Google and the Harris Poll asked politicians about their cybersecurity risks. Forty percent said they've had an account compromised in a phishing attack. And 60% said they haven't significantly updated the security of their accounts since 2016. So what should campaigns do to get serious about security? At the top of the list is taking basic precautions to protect email and other accounts. That includes multifactor authentication, which requires people to enter not just a password but also a code sent to their smartphone or from a special hardware key. Experts also recommend using password managers and communicating on encrypted messaging apps, like Signal and Wickr. It is not just candidates and staff who should be tightening up their online security but also the people operating in the periphery who might be helping out the campaign. "You have a spouse that could be vulnerable; you have children; you have the candidate's best friend who's also the finance chair," said Michael Kaiser, president of Defending Digital Campaigns, another nonprofit that connects campaigns with free and discounted cybersecurity services and training. If any of the campaign helpers have access to private information and they get hacked, their accounts can be used to target the candidate. Experts say the focus in 2020 is not just on reducing risk but on planning how to respond if a cyberattack happens. Otherwise, candidates will be battling adversaries not only at the ballot box but in their inboxes too.
The Indicator Plays 'Ms. Monopoly',https://www.npr.org/2020/01/27/800157576/the-indicator-plays-ms-monopoly,January 27, 2020, The classic game of Monopoly is derived from a game Elizabeth "Lizzie" Magie invented in the early 1900s. It was called The Landlord's Game, and it was supposed to teach people about the evils of land monopolies.  Ironically, Monopoly has become an icon of capitalism. And as with many legendary brands, it got a bit of a makeover last year. Hasbro, the company that owns Monopoly, rolled out a new version of the board game called Ms. Monopoly. This iteration of the game was intended to illustrate the gender pay gap and celebrate female entrepreneurs.  So, we decided to play it. On today's show, Stacey, Cardiff, and economist Martha Gimbel play Ms. Monopoly. Music by Drop Electric. Find us: Twitter / Facebook / Newsletter.

 U.S. immigration policy has been a boon for the tech industry in Canada. Hundreds of tech workers pack an auditorium for a recent networking event in Toronto. The evening's host glides around the room on a hoverboard, equal parts game show host and techie. "Who here is new to Canada?" asks Jason Goldlist, the co-founder of TechToronto, an organization that helps newcomers navigate the city's fast-growing tech ecosystem. Dozens of hands shoot up in the air — one belonging to Alok Chitnis, who moved to Canada last year. Chitnis is originally from India. He went to graduate school in the U.S. and found a job in Colorado. But last May, he moved to Canada to launch his own startup. "It's vibrant. It's very welcoming for immigrants," Chitnis says. "There are a lot of services by the government to help newcomer entrepreneurs especially. So the whole ecosystem is pretty welcoming compared to the U.S." If there is a war for global tech talent, right now Canada is winning — and the U.S. may be losing its edge. Toronto saw the biggest growth in technology jobs of any North American city over the past five years, outpacing San Francisco, New York and Seattle. Vancouver also made the top five. The tech industry across Canada is booming. And one of the biggest reasons is U.S. immigration policy. The Trump administration has made it harder for high-skilled workers to get visas. It also has blocked entrepreneurs from some majority-Muslim countries altogether under the travel ban, which it's moving to expand to more countries. Canada, meanwhile, has been making it easier for tech workers to immigrate there. A new streamlined visa in Canada has brought in more than 40,000 tech workers from around the world in the past two years alone. "While the States has gone, 'Let's make it difficult to get the employees here on a visa,' Canada's gone the exact opposite, and it's beneficial for Canada," says Alex Norman, the other co-founder of TechToronto. "You had a fast-growing ecosystem here that's been getting a shot of steroids." Under the Trump administration, high-skilled workers are getting rejected at a higher rate. In 2015, 92% of new H-1B visa applications were approved. But in the last two years, the approval rate dipped to only 75%. Immigration authorities say they're trying to ensure that companies follow the rules. Employers are required to show that hiring a foreign worker will not hurt Americans. "You know, I have a high regard — as does the president — for protecting U.S. workers," said Ken Cuccinelli, who was then the acting head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in an interview last year. Cuccinelli was asked about the need to crack down on fraud and abuse. "The H-1B program has been controversial in this regard," he said. "And it is concerning." Meanwhile, U.S. tech companies complain that they can't find enough qualified candidates to fill all their open jobs. More than a dozen hiring managers from tech startups recently squeezed into a private dining room at Del Posto, a high-end New York City restaurant. One of them was Susan Riskin, the head of human resources at Bitly, which is well-known for making Web addresses shorter. "We doubled the size of our technology team in the last year," Riskin said. "And we feel like we have exhausted New York and Denver. And now it's like we're trying to figure out where to go next, what we need to do." All of the hiring managers at the table were confronting a similar problem. They came for the New York strip steak and Italian wine — but also to hear a business pitch from Irfhan Rawji, the founder of a Canadian company called MobSquad . "If you'd rather fill a job than go without, call us," Rawji said. "We'll open a virtual subsidiary for you in Canada. You get access to the world." Rawji's pitch, in a nutshell, is this: Say your firm wants to hire an international tech worker, but the worker's visa application is rejected or the application process is dragging on for months. "The next-best solution to keeping them here in the U.S., if you can't do that, is to put them in Canada," Rawji said. "The flights are an hour and a half to two hours. It's the same business culture. And we try to match or beat the total cost for you here." U.S. tech companies have long relied on a steady stream of engineers and software developers from China, India and elsewhere. The process of getting an H-1B visa was often expensive and slow, says Meagan Soszynski, the head of human resources for an advertising app called Yieldmo. But at least it was predictable. "You followed a certain process, you paid a premium, but you pretty much always got the outcome that you wanted," says Soszynski. She says that's not the case anymore. "In the last year, I would say every one of my H-1B cases have been met with some sort of delay," Soszynski says. "So the immigration changes are certainly being felt by us on the front lines." The U.S. remains a popular destination for international workers. The number of applicants for H-1B visas stills exceeds the annual cap of 85,000. But in recent years, fewer are applying. "The biggest thing that's going to hurt the U.S. competitiveness is the overall rhetoric or tone" on immigration, says William Kerr, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of The Gift of Global Talent, who also serves on the board of MobSquad. "If you think about migration, people are making a choice to come and invest in their lives, whether for school or for work, and they want to have long-term opportunities," Kerr says. "And the uncertainty and the hostility really dampen that enthusiasm." President Trump says he understands the problem. "We have to allow smart people to stay in our country," Trump said in an interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News this month. "We don't have enough of them. And we have to be competitive with the rest of the world too," Trump said. But global tech workers say the Trump administration's policies make the U.S. less attractive. Ozge Yoluk started a new job in Toronto this month. She was born in Turkey and studied in Europe. Yoluk worked as a postdoctoral researcher in computational biology at the University of Maryland in Baltimore. She says the field is "like playing video games" — except in these games, the characters are proteins and experimental drugs. The company she joined, ProteinQure, is using tech to design new treatments. Pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. are doing similar work. But Yoluk says she didn't even bother applying for those jobs. "Getting a visa in the U.S. is not easy," Yoluk says. "And it's really costly, not just for the companies but also for the person itself." 
                Ozge Yoluk, a tech worker at ProteinQure, says she didn't bother looking for jobs in the United States.

 Ozge Yoluk, a tech worker at ProteinQure, says she didn't bother looking for jobs in the United States. Yoluk says the higher rejection rate for work visas has made U.S. companies more reluctant to sponsor foreign workers — and foreign workers more reluctant to go through the process. "I said I will not waste my time applying for positions in the States," Yoluk said. "Whereas in Canada, the process was easy." Yoluk says she got her Canadian visa approved in about two weeks. She didn't even need a lawyer to navigate the process. A few blocks away, I met Milad Zabihi at a coffee shop in downtown Toronto. Zabihi is the CEO of a startup called Peekage, which helps companies target customers. Zabihi immigrated to Canada from Iran. Several of the company's other co-founders are also Iranian. "We are a bunch of friends from university time," Zabihi says. "We were thinking of like, you know, starting something new." Zabihi says they wanted to locate this new venture in the United States. But then, Trump's travel ban blocked most immigrants and visitors from Iran and several other Muslim-majority countries. "Everyone's like, OK, the U.S. is not an option," Zabihi says. "Especially we like, you know, what is happening right now with the new administration and Islam. So we were basically thinking of, like, what would be the best next option." Now big U.S. tech firms are following global tech workers north of the border. Google, Microsoft, Intel and Uber have either opened or announced plans for new offices in Canada. "Toronto's now the fastest-growing tech city in North America," said Yung Wu, the CEO of the MaRS Discovery District, a technology hub in Toronto that's home to 150 tech startups. It takes up most of a city block, with multiple buildings connected by a soaring glass atrium. Wu says the Toronto tech industry has been growing for a while. But the U.S. immigration crackdown accelerated that growth. "Look, every time Trump tweets, we get another sort of injection, which is all good from my perspective," Wu says. "Companies are locating here because they can get access to foreign talent faster." Wu says hiring the right people at the right time can be the difference between a company that succeeds and one that doesn't. Canada is betting on it.
'Franchise' Tracks The Rise And Role Of Fast Food In Black America,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/25/797143165/franchise-tracks-the-rise-and-role-of-fast-food-in-black-america,January 25, 2020, The Golden Arches in Black America by Marcia Chatelain Hardcover, 336 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Let's talk about fast food — and I bet you have a jingle in your head right now, because according to a new book, on any given day in America, an estimated one third of all American adults is eating something at a fast food restaurant. But fast food doesn't mean the same thing to everyone everywhere. For some, owning a franchise has been a path to wealth, but fast food restaurants are hyper-concentrated in some of the country's lowest-income and most segregated areas. And according to the Centers for Disease Control, African Americans are more likely to eat fast food than any other racial group in America — which is why fast food is also seen as the culprit for the high rates of obesity, diabetes and heart disease among black people. So how did that happen? And is fast food the hero or the villain in black America? In her new book Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America, history professor Marcia Chatelain traces what she calls the hidden history of the relationships between the struggle for civil rights and the expansion of the fast food industry. Chatelain says that as a child, she constantly noticed that museums and cultural sites in her home town of Chicago had signs indicating they'd been sponsored by the local black McDonald's operators association. "And so this book really explores the relationship between black America and McDonald's, to help us understand where other parts of our society has failed, McDonald's has unfortunately had to pick up the slack." McDonald's is a big part of this conversation, and we should mention here that the estate of Joan Kroc — the widow of McDonald's Corporation founder Ray Kroc — is among NPR's financial supporters. On how come McDonald's franchises became so important to black owners Ray Kroc was not a racial progressive, but what he was was a person who was very much committed to the expansion of McDonald's. And while he initially concentrated on expansion in the suburbs after the uprisings that followed Martin Luther King's assassination in 1968, the business community saw an opportunity, because there were deep demands for more commerce. The federal government was underwriting minority business initiatives that supported the growth of franchises. And even more importantly, the civil rights establishment started to pivot towards black capitalism as its priority. And those forces all came together to bring McDonald's to black America. On the unrest of 1968 Well, 1968 is such a critical moment in the story, because I think we often forget about the impact of economic white flight in the inner city. We often focus on residential white flight and the impact on schools and tax bases. But many people left the inner city because they were afraid of future uprisings and they no longer wanted to deal with the questions of accountability that black consumers were making on them. And so as this exodus was happening, McDonald's saw an opportunity to install African American franchise owners in the abandoned stores. But they also saw the drop in the value of property in these neighborhoods, and their ability to expand at cheaper rates also helped with the expansion of their restaurants in this community. On the first black McDonald's franchise owner, Herman Petty I think any time we have communities that have to rely on a business to be the place of refuge, to be the place for wifi, to be the sponsor of youth sports, to be the place where the youth job program happens, for the college scholarships to emanate from, then we have a problem. Marcia Chatelain Herman Petty represents, I think, a lot of the men who were early in African-American franchising. There were these men who had opportunities through military, some of them were college educated — but they all had to contend with the roadblock of discriminatory lending practices, so was hard to get bank loans. They wanted to create businesses in their community and see opportunities. And they also trusted black women to be able to execute and really do the hard work in the stores. And so while women had been kind of banished from McDonald's after the McDonald brothers really wanted to focus on mechanization and thought they were flirting and they would be too much of distraction, what Herman Petty understood was that these jobs were ideal places for black women who were trusted in the community and who could deliver on the incredibly demanding needs of a McDonald's franchise. On whether McDonald's has been a net negative or a net positive in the black community McDonald's provides us a prism for wondering why does McDonald's have to have such an important role in certain communities, and in others it can just be a place to eat? I think that for African Americans who chose franchising as the path forward, it's very easy for us to belittle them. But we know how this story ended, of the 1960s and the 1970s. I think what McDonald's has provided is an opportunity for some, at the expense of far too many ... not just the health effects; I think any time we have communities that have to rely on a business to be the place of refuge, to be the place for wifi, to be the sponsor of youth sports, to be the place where the youth job program happens, for the college scholarships to emanate from, then we have a problem.

 Emergency personnel work the scene of the early morning explosion that Houston Fire Chief Samuel Peña said caused significant damage to nearby homes and even knocked some off their foundations. Updated at 2:39 p.m. ET A massive industrial explosion in northwest Houston early Friday killed two people, left a business in ruins, knocked homes off their foundations and sent debris flying for about half a mile. The predawn blast at a building belonging to Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, which provides industrial services such as thermal spray coatings, could be felt more than 30 miles away, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said at a news conference.  Acevedo said it's not clear whether the victims were employees. He said authorities have opened a criminal investigation into the incident but that there was currently no reason to think the explosion was intentional. Friday's incident is just the latest in a string of industrial explosions in Texas' Gulf Coast region, which houses numerous chemical facilities.  It's not yet clear what caused the explosion, which jolted the area at about 4:30 a.m. local time.  "Multiple buildings and homes had their windows broken in and doors blown off their hinges," Houston Public Media's Davis Land reported. "[The explosion] knocked us all out of our bed, it was so strong," resident Mark Brady told Click2Houston. "It busted out every window in our house. It busted everybody's garage door in around here ... and closer toward the explosion over here, it busted people's roofs in and walls in and we don't know what it is. ... It's a warzone over here." Ground zero from today’s explosion. Please keep our community in your prayers. #RelationalPolicing pic.twitter.com/B3ZjKy5d7F One resident told the local news station that her roof of her home collapsed. "The whole house is ruined," she said. "The whole ceiling crashed down on all of us. We were all trapped in there and a nice family came and helped us out. ... It's just trashed." The moment of the explosion was caught on video by a doorbell surveillance camera, which shows a bright ball of fire light up the sky.  VIDEO: Doorbell camera captures explosion in northwest Houston - https://t.co/rvjZWj1HoT #kprc2 #hounews pic.twitter.com/QBWmi9VAQg Authorities initially were concerned because valves on propylene tanks at the site were releasing the colorless and highly flammable gas into the air, but Houston Fire Chief Samuel Peña said the leak has since been contained. A small, contained area at the Watson Grinding and Manufacturing site was still on fire, he said, adding that fire officials have decided to let it burn out on its own.  "This is going to be a long-term incident. We're going to be out here for several days," Peña said. He encouraged residents who find debris in their yards or on their roofs to call authorities. "We've actually had to get some of our employees to bring in their own personal drones to actually start looking at rooftops in the vicinity," Acevedo said. "We've started a grid search for evidence." The police chief also warned against any attempt to loot homes in the area. "This is, in essence, a disaster area right now," he said. "Word to the wise — do not get caught looting because it will not be a slap on the wrist." On Friday afternoon, a law firm that says it represents multiple families whose homes were damaged filed a request for a temporary restraining order against Watson Grinding and Manufacturing so that any evidence at the blast site is preserved.  Houston authorities were setting up an evacuation center for residents who need to leave their homes because of damage.  Fire and police officials had initially recommended that families leave the area, though they later urged residents to shelter in place. The fire department said 48 people have taken shelter at a church, as the Red Cross works to find an overnight shelter for them.  A local school district, Cypress-Fairbanks, said it was closing two schools near the blast site on Friday. Several school districts have said they plan to keep students indoors for the day. Nearby roads were being closed, and Acevedo said that would last into Saturday.  Hazmat teams are doing air quality assessments, though Peña stated: "We have no reports of accumulation or hazards to the air quality." The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality also said it has deployed staff to assist with those assessments at the scene.  Late last year, TCEQ Executive Director Toby Baker said he has seen "an unacceptable trend of significant incidents impacting the Gulf Coast region."   "While not all emergency events may be prevented, it is imperative that industry be accountable and held to the highest standard of compliance to ensure the safety of the state's citizens and the protection of the environment," he added.  In November, an explosion at a chemical plant in Port Neches, Texas, injured three people and damaged nearby homes. In July, more than 30 people were treated for minor injuries after a fire at an Exxon Mobil refinery in Baytown, Texas.  And early last year, as Houston Public Media's Florian Martin reported, three chemical fires — one of them deadly — hit the Houston area in the span of a month. A Houston Chronicle investigation in 2016 found that 12 petrochemical explosions, fires or toxic releases had happened in the Houston area between November 2014 and May 2016.

 Insys Therapeutics founder John Kapoor was convicted in a bribery and kickback scheme that prosecutors said helped fuel the opioid crisis. Updated at 5:30 p.m. ET  Former billionaire and pharmaceutical executive John Kapoor has been sentenced to five years and six months in prison. His sentencing is the culmination of a months-long criminal trial in Boston's Moakley U.S. Courthouse that resulted in the first successful prosecution of pharmaceutical executives tied to the opioid epidemic. The 76-year-old is the founder of Insys Therapeutics, which made and aggressively marketed the potent opioid painkiller Subsys. Kapoor's 66-month prison term is substantially less than the 15-year sentence recommended by federal prosecutors, but it is more than the one year requested by Kapoor's defense attorneys, who maintained the executive's innocence and stressed his old age as reason for a short prison sentence. U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs explained that she reached the lesser sentence after considering Kapoor's advanced age and philanthropy, as well as "his central role in the crime," The Associated Press reported. Kapoor and four other executives were found guilty last year of orchestrating a criminal conspiracy to bribe doctors to prescribe the company's medication, including to patients who didn't need it. They then lied to insurance companies to make sure the costly oral fentanyl spray was covered. The painkiller, which was intended for cancer patients, could cost as much as $19,000 a month. Two other executives pleaded guilty and became cooperating witnesses. The other executives received between one year and 33 months, significantly less than many of the prison terms recommended by the federal prosecutors. Earlier on Thursday, Insys sales chief Alec Burlakoff was sentenced to 26 months in prison for his role in the bribery and fraud scheme. "This was an offense of greed," Burroughs said before sentencing Burlakoff. The sales executive hired a stripper as a Subsys sales representative to help persuade doctors to boost prescriptions. The woman, named Sunrise Lee, eventually was promoted to oversee a third of the company's sales force. "I didn't think of who we were at Insys and how unethical what we were doing was," he told the judge on Thursday, according to Bloomberg. "The only thing I could think was how could I keep up with the fast and furious pace necessary to get ahead." For the federal government, this was a landmark trial in which corporate executives were charged under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, a charge often reserved for mob bosses and drug lords. Experts saw the trial as sending a message to drug companies that they will be held criminally accountable for their alleged role in fueling the opioid crisis. "I think this is just the tip of the iceberg," said Brad Bailey, a former federal prosecutor and current defense attorney who has been following the Insys trial closely. "It's a template that prosecutors will continue to use." While these seven Insys executives have been in court and awaiting sentencing, the company entered into an agreement with the government to settle criminal and civil investigations. Insys agreed to pay $225 million and admitted to the kickback scheme. Shortly after the agreement was announced, the company filed for bankruptcy. Bailey said that between the prison sentences and the company's financial woes, "there's no question that this was a cautionary tale to all executives." Ameet Sarpatwari, a physician and the assistant director of Harvard University's Program on Regulation, Therapeutics, and Law, thinks this trial will have a chilling effect on the pharmaceutical industry. "It's an important warning to other pharmaceutical manufacturers and executives who may be considering pushing their products through aggressive, and possibly legally dubious, marketing schemes," said Sarpatwari. "The consequences for such actions may not simply be fines — which has historically simply been the cost of doing business — but possibly jail time." However, he said, this successful prosecution does not mean the practices that contributed to overprescribing and addiction to opioids will go away. "A lot of the activities that you see within the industry that are effective are technically legal. And so, if that's the case, is this going to curb those aggressive tactics? No, but it will give second thought to pushing the boundaries," said Sarpatwari. "I think that is going to be the hopefully helpful fallout of the case."

 Sandra Joyce, the head of global intelligence at the cybersecurity firm FireEye, speaks at the company's Cyber Defense Summit in 2018. Private tech companies are increasingly taking the lead in reporting information about suspected attacks by foreign actors. In some cases, the companies sell their reports to the U.S. intelligence community. The U.S. government says it's on high alert for cyberattacks from foreign countries in this election year. Yet private cybersecurity firms have often been the ones sounding the alarm, and in some cases, they are selling their services to the U.S. intelligence community. "We've seen Iran impersonating political candidates," said Sandra Joyce, the head of global intelligence at FireEye, a leading cybersecurity company. "They've even fabricated letters that look like they're coming from concerned citizens. They get themselves published in newspapers. Well-known newspapers. But they're influence operators from Iran. They're not concerned citizens from Texas," she added. Whether it's Iran, Russia or other foreign actors, cybersecurity companies and research groups have been often been more public than the government in identifying potential foreign threats. "The government doesn't have a monopoly on tracking, identifying or exposing some of these vulnerabilities," said Graham Brookie, who runs the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council in Washington. "The threat is evolving and threats are becoming more diffuse, more complex and in some ways more open." The U.S. government says it welcomes help from tech companies, according to Shelby Pierson, who works for the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire. She was appointed last year to a newly created position that puts her in charge of coordinating election security across the intelligence community.  "There is a whole consortium of players in this landscape which include private security firms," Pierson told NPR in an interview. "Those organizations will actually have deeper and technical insight into those networks before the intelligence community will.  "Pierson said the government sometimes buys services from cybersecurity companies, and she cited a couple of the biggest players in the industry.  "FireEye and CrowdStrike, for example, have done really good work, where based on the analysis, expertise and information analysis that they do, those are products and services that they can sell to the U.S. government." The cyber firm Area 1 Security said it recently detected Russian military intelligence breaking into the computer systems of Burisa. That's the Ukranian gas company where Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, used to be on the board. This raised suspicions that the Russians are looking for dirt on the Bidens. Area 1 has received a lot of media attention for this report — which is good for a private company. However, the tight-lipped U.S. intelligence community hasn't offered its own assessment. So what's the government's position on the report — does it agree, disagree, or just prefer to remain silent? "Of course, these topics are news and newsworthy," said Brookie, of the Atlantic Council. But he warned that we're going to see a wide range of opinions on how much public attention a potential threat should receive.  Tech companies have incentives to publicize threats they've uncovered. The media is looking for scoops. Yet the government might be inclined to say little or nothing. "And we, collectively between government and media and tech have not shown that we know what to do with that," Brookie said. The government is wrestling with the issue, said Pierson. "Some of my [government] colleagues have said, 'Maybe we shouldn't necessarily spook the herd and share all this information,'" she said. "Maybe people go, 'You know what, this is all rigged. That's so much disinformation. I'm not going to vote.' That would be worst case scenario. And frankly, doing the work of our adversaries for them." However, a number of government agencies have pledged to be more open than in the past. The FBI, for example, recently expanded its policy for issuing notifications when it detects a cyberattack. Private cybersecurity firms say they often hire people who have worked in the intelligence community. And the companies stress that they cultivate close relationships with the government. "We definitely work in lockstep with law enforcement and the intelligence community," said Karim Hijazi, the head of Prevailion, a cybersecurity company in Houston. "We want to make sure that we're not misstepping." His firm put out a report earlier this month saying Iran is probing the computer systems at oil and gas companies.  As all this plays out, many Americans say they're concerned about election security. A poll by NPR, the PBS NewsHour and Marist found 41 percent of those surveyed believe the U.S. is not well prepared, or not prepared at all, to protect the November ballot from interference.

 The phone of Jeff Bezos allegedly was hacked via a WhatsApp account held by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Updated at 1:26 p.m. ET Friday If Jeff Bezos can't keep his phone safe, how can the rest of us hope to?  Sure, Bezos, Amazon's CEO and the owner of The Washington Post, is smart and presumably has good security people helping him, says Matthew Green, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University. But, Green says, "the bad thing about being Jeff Bezos is that there are a lot of people with huge amounts of money who want to hack you." Still, a targeted hack like the one the Saudis allegedly used against Bezos to get troves of information off his phone — which involved a video file allegedly sent by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Bezos over WhatsApp — is costly and hard to pull off, says Green, an expert on cryptography and cybersecurity. Green says that if you're not very wealthy and not a celebrity, a politician or a top executive, "you probably are not a target." At least for that type of attack. That's the good news. The not-so-good news: Research shows that more general-purpose malware aimed at phones that the rest of us use is also on the rise. So here's what you need to know to reduce your chances of getting hacked. There is a whole netherworld of questionable apps that exists outside the supported app stores run by Apple, Google and Amazon. Many people "jailbreak," or alter, their phones so they can install apps from outside the mainstream app stores — apps that look like games or promise to let you watch a big Hollywood blockbuster before it's officially released. But "that dramatically increases your risk for installing malicious apps," says Tim Erlin, a cybersecurity expert at Tripwire. Overall, phones are getting much harder for hackers to break into, Green says. He says even if your phone is compromised in some way by malicious code, that doesn't mean the hackers can open all your apps, look inside them and get your bank account numbers, emails with your tax returns for your accountant or whatever else. "Every single app you have runs in what's called a sandbox. Basically, it's isolated from all the other apps on the phone," Green says. "So even if there's a bug in one app ... that could lead to something bad — some malware being installed that affects that app. But generally speaking, it won't spread throughout your phone." So that's a crucial protection to make hacks much more difficult. But if you jailbreak your phone, you're throwing aside that digital security and leaving yourself much more vulnerable. Green notes that if your phone is four or five years old, you also don't have some of these important newer protections and are more at risk. Hackers and the phone manufacturers are in an ongoing race. The hackers find vulnerabilities, and then fixes are included in the software updates for your phone. Social media and messaging companies are in this race against the hackers too. Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, warned about and fixed a video file vulnerability last year, but it's unclear whether it was the same one that allowed Bezos' iPhone to be hacked in 2018. Where you play a role in all this is by installing the latest updates to your phone and the apps installed on it. "Keeping your phone updated is an important step in keeping it secure as well," Erlin says. "It's important to install those updates when they're available." This is where having an old phone can be a problem. "It's a choice you can make: If you don't want to move to a newer phone, you want to accept that risk. Lots of people do, but it does put you at greater risk, because you're no longer receiving security updates," Erlin says. In traditional phishing attempts, you might get an email on your computer asking you to click on a link or download a file that contains malware. But for hackers targeting phones, the threat might not be in an email. "If you think about the apps that you use most commonly, maybe it's Facebook, maybe it's Instagram, maybe it's some other app where you have the capability to send and receive messages," Erlin says. "An example would be that in Instagram, you receive a link. Maybe it's not a file — maybe it's a link from someone you know or you follow that says, 'Here, I made this for you.' " Just like with email phishing accounts, Erlin says, watch out for vague and general-sounding messages asking you to open a file or click on a link. Even if the message comes from someone you know, the person's account may have been compromised. "And so you click on that link and it compromises your phone," Erlin says. Be careful about being tricked into giving away passwords or other sensitive personal or financial information. Erlin remembers a couple of years ago, an attacker was trying to get people to enter their credentials for their bank account so the hackers could steal them. Erlin adds: "And they had compromised the phone in such a way that they replaced the phone number for the bank account with a phone number that they controlled, so that when you tried to call your bank to say, 'Hey, I can't get into my bank account,' you ended up with a person who was associated with this attack. That's a fairly sophisticated type of operation, but it was possible at that time." SIM-swap scams are some of the scariest phone hacks. They're more difficult and time intensive to pull off. So they're not that common, but they are on the rise. Samy Tarazi, a criminal investigator with the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office in California, works on a regional task force on the problem. He says he knows of about 4,000 cases nationally, "but there are more than that." With a SIM swap, fraudsters take control of a victim's phone number. Tarazi says there are multiple ways they can do this. They might trick the phone company and claim they lost their phone and need to transfer the number. Sometimes it's an inside job where they bribe a phone company employee. Once they get that number transferred over to a phone that the hackers control, Tarazi says, often "that phone number is linked to all of the victim's online accounts — their bank accounts." Those accounts use the cellphone number to verify a customer's identity when the customer wants to do something like change a password. A bank might send you a text message with a temporary code that you then use to change your account's password. So without knowing any of your actual passwords, a hacker can take control of an email account and then have control of both your phone number and your email. "From there, he can reset passwords to any other service — banks, cryptocurrency ... social media," Tarazi says. People have lost large sums of money this way, he says. But Tarazi says there is a way to protect yourself: "We highly recommend that people not use their cellphone number as a form of verification of identity." Instead, he says, you should tell financial institutions and other services that you use that you want to use a password and some other form of two-step verification.  Tarazi says some companies may allow you to use a special authenticator app for this. Or he says you could use security questions that you know the answer to. But he says you should make up fictional answers if the security questions can be researched and figured out by others. This is actually an area where phones are getting more secure. Green says if you're running a relatively new phone with the most updated operating system, you don't have to worry that much about whether plugging into a public charging station or connecting to a public Wi-Fi network is going to let hackers break into your phone. "There's still always a chance that somebody could look at the traffic going over the network. You should worry about that," Green says. "But really, hacking into your phone is getting much, much harder." But Tarazi says you do want to be more careful when traveling abroad. He says many people want to use Wi-Fi to avoid roaming charges, and that's OK. But, he says, be careful if you try to use a public network and it prompts you to do something suspicious. "Sometimes it's download this app and then use it to log in," Tarazi says. "If it ever requires you to download something, definitely do not do that." Even with the improved security for smartphones, often you don't realize you've been hacked until it's too late. And if somebody opens a credit card in your name or steals money from an account, you also don't know how they got your personal information — from your phone, stealing your mail or the Equifax breach or some other massive hack of a corporation. If the address book on your phone is compromised, an attacker would be able to email spam with malicious links to all your contacts. If one of those contacts clicks on the link and then does some online banking, "that lets the hackers steal credentials for their bank account and then they have access to that bank account," Erlin says. Tarazi of the Santa Clara DA's office says that with so many ways to have your personal financial information stolen, it's a good idea to call the three major credit bureaus and tell them to put a freeze on your credit report. That makes it much harder for identity thieves to open a new bank account or credit card using your name.
Federal Government May Tighten Restrictions On Service Animals On Planes,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/23/798662547/federal-government-may-tighten-restrictions-on-service-animals-on-planes,January 23, 2020,

 The number of pets on planes has become a hot-button issue of late as emotional support animals have become more common than ever. The U.S. Department of Transportation is considering tightening the rules for taking service animals on planes after increased customer complaints and lobbying from the airlines who think current regulations are too lenient. The Department of Transportation would no longer require airlines to consider emotional support animals to be service animals, as they have in the past. It also would require additional paperwork for service dogs, which some disability advocates find troubling. In recent years, a spate of incidents in which people attempted to fly with exotic animals such as a squirrel or a peacock for emotional support have raised questions about whether the regulations are too permissive and prone to easy abuse. Taylor Garland, a spokesperson for the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, says the group has seen an exponential increase in emotional support animals in the past five years. The union believes people who don't actually need their animal for emotional support to travel sometimes abuse the system. "What it's caused is a number of safety, health and security issues onboard our aircraft, which has led to minor things like animals loose in the cabin to very serious safety issues where untrained animals have attacked flight attendants or other passengers or other legitimate service dogs," she said. The department said in a statement that it "wants to ensure that individuals with disabilities can continue using their service animals while also reducing the likelihood that passengers wishing to travel with their pets on aircraft will be able to falsely claim their pets are service animals." Under the new rules, service animals would have a stricter definition: "a dog that is individually trained to do work or to perform tasks for the benefit of a person with a disability." Dogs providing psychiatric support to an individual would need to be specially trained, as other service animals are. Jennifer Mathis, the director of policy and legal advocacy at the Bazelon Center For Mental Health Law, applauded the inclusion of service dogs helping people with psychiatric disabilities. "If you use a service animal, service animals should be treated the same whatever type of disability you have." But she finds the definition of service animal too narrow. "There are many legitimate reasons why people may use an assistance animal ... that accommodates a disability, a real disability and accommodates that disability in a very, very real and important way, even though it's not specifically trained to do a task," she says. The proposed change would allow airlines to require a wide range of forms from passengers with service animals. For example, the passenger would have to attest that the animal is in good health and has good behavior and training. They'd also need to fill out a form saying the animal can avoid relieving itself during the flight, or do so in a way that is sanitary. The sheer amount of paperwork is troubling to Mathis, who says it could be a barrier to people getting on a plane with their service animal. "While [the documents] may seem reasonable on their face, I think that, you know, the cumulative effect of making people attest to all these things is likely to scare some people off." The changes were prompted by an increase in complaints about animals. For example, according to the text of the proposal, U.S. and foreign airlines received 3,065 service animal complaints from passengers in 2018, compared with 719 in 2013. "Passengers have attempted to fly with many different unusual species of animals, such as a peacock, ducks, turkeys, pigs, iguanas, and various other types of animals as emotional support or service animals, causing confusion for airline employees and additional scrutiny for service animal users," the proposal reads. The public now has two months to comment on the changes. In recent years, some individual airlines have changed their policies on emotional support animals. A group of disability advocacy organizations have recently pushed the Department of Transportation to "stop the proliferation of a patchwork of service animal access requirements in airlines' service animal policies," according to the department. United Airlines changed its policies on emotional support animals in 2018 because of "a significant increase in onboard incidents involving these animals." The customers needed to confirm that the animal has been "trained to behave properly in a public setting" and provide a letter from a veterinarian about the animal's health.

 Prompted by layoffs of thousands of Toys R Us employees, New Jersey's governor this week signed into law measures providing extra protections for workers. New Jersey became the first state in the country to enact a law that guarantees severance pay for mass layoffs, according to the bill's sponsors this week.  The legislation, signed by Gov. Phil Murphy on Tuesday, ensures that businesses with 100 or more full-time employees pay their workers one week of severance pay for every year of service whenever widespread downsizing or plant closures affecting 50 or more employees is on the horizon. The law also requires employers to give workers at least 90 days notice when such changes are imminent. That's up from 60 days.  If companies fail to comply they will be required to add an extra four-week payout to an employee's severance package.  "When these corporate takeover artists plunge the companies into bankruptcy they walk away with windfall profits and pay top executives huge bonuses, but the little guys get screwed," Sen. Joe Cryan, a co-sponsor of the bill, wrote in a Facebook post.  The landmark legislation — S3170 — was prompted by the recent closure of several big name retail companies throughout the state over the last two years, including Toys R Us.  The company declared bankruptcy in 2017 after a private equity buyout left the company billions of dollars in debt. More than 30,000 workers were laid off nationwide — 2,000 of them in New Jersey, NJ.com reported. Initially, workers were told they would not be receiving any form of severance, but the toy store's former employees organized with the help of United for Respect to demand some compensation.  Meanwhile, as NPR's Amy Held reported, a bankruptcy judge granted the struggling retailer "permission to pay millions of dollars in bonuses to executives after the company argued it was necessary to motivate its top brass during the critical holiday shopping season." Eventually, the private equity firms, KKR and Bain Capital, capitulated to public pressure. The companies established a $20 million financial assistance fund for workers.  While it was a victory for some New Jersey workers in financial straits, United for Respect noted its effects were limited to a small subset of unemployed residents.  But with the new law, Cryan remarked all employees working for some of the state's largest companies will have added protections.  "The law better protects the rights of the employees," Cryan said. "Workers' performance and workers' dedication to the company were secondary. Now, they'll be moved more to the forefront."  Critics argue the new measures will deter companies from expanding or moving to New Jersey.  The law goes into effect in July.

 This chicken from Memphis Meats was produced with cells taken from an animal and grown into meat in a "cultivator." The process is analogous to how yeast is grown in breweries to produce beer. Memphis Meats, a Berkeley, Calif.-based startup, says it's one step closer to bringing cell-based meat to consumers' mouths. The company plans to build a pilot production facility with funds raised from high-profile investors including Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Kimbal Musk, as well as two giant players in the animal protein and feed space, Cargill and Tyson Foods. The company says its latest funding round has brought in $161 million in new investment. "People thought this was all science fiction" when the company was founded back in 2015, Uma Valeti, the co-founder and CEO of Memphis Meats, told NPR in an interview at the company's headquarters. "Everything that we've done at Memphis Meats [has] started to show that this can be done," Valeti said. "This is real." Interest in cell-based meat production and other meat alternatives has increased amid growing awareness of the environmental impact of traditional livestock agriculture. Valeti and his team walked us through the process of producing cell-based meat. It starts with the selection of specific types of animal cells that can grow to become meat. Next, the cells are fed and put in a "cultivator" — similar to a fermenting tank — where they can grow and form muscle and connective tissue. The process is analogous to the way breweries grow yeast cells to produce beer. Only here, they're growing animal cells.

 Memphis Meats CEO Uma Valeti (right) stands with Morgan Rease, the company's formulations scientist, while they cook up a sample of cell-based chicken. I got the chance to sample Memphis Meats' chicken, which was pan-sautéed with some oil and served with greens. It tasted pretty close to chicken breast produced the traditional way — but without as much textural variation among bits of muscle, fat and connective tissue. The pilot production facility, which is expected to be built in the next 18 to 24 months, will allow the company to scale up and experiment with its meat products, which also include duck and beef. But Memphis Meats and its competitors face quite a few hurdles in bringing cell-based meats to market. For starters, the cost of production needs to come down. Back in 2018, Wired reported that a pound of Memphis Meats takes $2,400 to produce, in part because of the expensive growth mediums — or feed — needed to culture cells. "Our costs have continued to come down significantly over the last three years," Valeti told us in an email Wednesday. "We have a clear path to bringing a cost competitive product to market as we scale our production and that's part of what our latest funding round will help us to unlock," Valeti said. He said the company will continue to work on developing low-cost feed for the cells, which is one significant piece of the puzzle. Decisions over how best to label, regulate and inspect cell-based meats are another challenge. In late 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that the two agencies would share regulatory oversight, but there are still many issues to resolve. "The agencies have outlined a path to market, Valeti said, "and we will continue providing them with the information they need to fill in the details." Memphis Meats has plenty of competitors in the space, and some of them are seeking regulatory approval outside the United States. As of last year, there were 27 cell-based meat and seafood companies around the world, according to the Good Food Institute.

 The phone of Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO and owner of The Washington Post, reportedly was hacked via a WhatsApp account owned by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Updated at 1:18 p.m. ET In 2018, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman sent a WhatsApp message to the world's richest man. That message was behind a high-profile hack of Jeff Bezos' phone, according to a report commissioned by the Amazon CEO and reviewed by United Nations human rights experts. "The information we have received suggests the possible involvement of the Crown Prince in surveillance of Mr. Bezos, in an effort to influence, if not silence, The Washington Post's reporting on Saudi Arabia," the experts said in a news release on the incident. Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.  Saudi Arabia called reports of the incident "absurd' and denied that it was responsible for hacking the phone of Bezos, who heads Amazon, one of the world's most influential and powerful tech companies. The experts — Agnes Callamard, U.N. special rapporteur on summary executions and extrajudicial killings, and David Kaye, U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of expression — said they were "gravely concerned" and called for an "immediate investigation by US and other relevant authorities, including investigation of the continuous, multi-year, direct and personal involvement of the Crown Prince in efforts to target perceived opponents." Callamard and Kaye raised their concerns with the Saudi government in a letter sent last week through the Saudi permanent mission to the U.N. in Geneva, Kaye told NPR. "We sent them a letter that says, this is the information we received. If it's true, it raises very serious concerns regarding very grave human rights violations. And we have some questions for you," he said. He said they have not received a formal response. The allegations raise the possibility that Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, was targeted by the Saudis months before the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi's death has been linked to the crown prince. The U.N. experts said: "The circumstances and timing of the hacking and surveillance of Bezos also strengthen support for further investigation by US and other relevant authorities of the allegations that the Crown Prince ordered, incited, or, at a minimum, was aware of planning for but failed to stop the mission that fatally targeted Mr. Khashoggi in Istanbul." Saudi Arabia denied that it was behind the hacking of Bezos' phone and also called for an investigation. "Recent media reports that suggest the Kingdom is behind a hacking of Mr. Jeff Bezos' phone are absurd," the Saudi Embassy in the U.S. said in a tweet Tuesday night. "We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out." Recent media reports that suggest the Kingdom is behind a hacking of Mr. Jeff Bezos' phone are absurd. We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out. Amazon and a lawyer for Bezos did not respond to requests for comment. The U.N. experts have been investigating Khashoggi's death. They reviewed a forensic analysis of Bezos' iPhone, commissioned by Bezos' security team and conducted by the consulting firm FTI. The FTI analysis found with "medium to high confidence" that the phone was hacked in May 2018, after Bezos received a video message from a WhatsApp account "utilized personally" by the Saudi crown prince, according to the U.N. experts. Just hours after the message was received, "massive and (for Bezos' phone) unprecedented exfiltration of data from the phone began," they said. The FTI analysis also found that the crown prince's WhatsApp account sent additional messages to Bezos in November 2018 and February 2019 that allegedly revealed "private and confidential information about Mr Bezos' personal life." In February 2019, Bezos accused the parent company of the National Enquirer of extortion. He said American Media Inc. threatened to publish potentially embarrassing personal photos of him if he did not stop an investigation into how the tabloid obtained other private photos and texts of him and his girlfriend. American Media denied the accusation. The National Enquirer was subsequently sold to James Cohen, a magazine distributor. Editor's note: Amazon is among NPR's financial supporters.

 Many Americans who get overwhelmed by student loan debt are told that student debt can't be erased through bankruptcy. Now more judges and lawyers say that's a myth and bankruptcy can help. A few years ago, Lauren had a big problem. The Queens, N.Y., resident had graduated from college with an art degree as the Great Recession had hit. She had private student loans with high interest rates. For work, all she could find were retail jobs. And by 2016, her loans had ballooned to about $200,000. " 'I can't afford to actually pay my bills and eat and pay my rent,' " she remembers thinking. "I was financially handicapped. I mean, my student loan payments were higher than my rent was." So Lauren started to look into bankruptcy. She doesn't want her last name used because she thinks all this might hurt her job prospects. Over the years, a myth has taken hold that you can't get student debt reduced or wiped out through bankruptcy. But many bankruptcy judges and legal scholars say that's wrong. And bankruptcy can be a way to get help. Bankruptcy is not fun. Your credit gets destroyed for years, and you have to be in pretty dire financial straits for it to make sense. But if you reach that point, you can get your debts reduced or erased through bankruptcy so you can get back on your feet. But the lawyers Lauren called said that with student loans it's different because there are special rules for student debt. "They had told me things like you have to have a disability where you're not able to even work," she says. "And I was like, 'Well, but that doesn't make any sense.' " Jason Iuliano, a Villanova University law professor, says that over the past 30 years, Congress has made it harder to discharge student debt. You need to meet what's called an "undue hardship" standard. That also means more work for your lawyer. But Iuliano says that this has created the misconception that it's nearly impossible to get help for student debt through bankruptcy. That's not true. Iuliano did some research and says a quarter-million student loan debtors file for bankruptcy each year. They do that because they have credit card debt or other debts and they can get those reduced or erased. But when it comes to trying to get their student debt forgiven, "more than 99% of the student loan debtors in bankruptcy just give up without even trying," Iuliano says. "It struck me as a really surprising statistic when I first uncovered it." For those who do try, though, Iuliano's research finds that about half the time the person gets some or all of the student loan debt erased. One study he did found that they got help through bankruptcy about 40% of the time. And he says more recent data from this past year show that figure rising to more than 50% of the time. "So I think that's really important for bankruptcy attorneys to see that there are judges out there who are willing to grant undue-hardship discharges and that people are much more likely to obtain relief in bankruptcy for their student loan debt," Iuliano says. Just this month, a federal judge in New York discharged more than $220,000 in student loans for a borrower. In her ruling, Chief Bankruptcy Judge Cecelia Morris criticized the fact that even many lawyers "believe it impossible to discharge student loans." She added, "This Court will not participate in perpetuating these myths." Robert Lawless, a law professor at the University of Illinois, says, "I think we're reaching a tipping point with what the bankruptcy courts are doing." He says he hopes more people are able to get help through bankruptcy. But he says the rules are still too restrictive. Lawless researched the issue with a group of attorneys and former judges for the American Bankruptcy Institute, a professional organization. They're recommending that Congress rewrite the rules on student loans in bankruptcy. Under the proposal, Lawless says, "after seven years from when the loans became due, they would be treated pretty much like any other debt in a bankruptcy case." There is at least some support for that in Congress. Part of the obstacle now is that the current rules often require paying your lawyer more money to attempt to get student debt forgiven. Lawless says it costs on average about $1,200 to file a typical Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. Bankruptcy attorneys say it can cost thousands of dollars more to pay your lawyer to jump through the extra hoops related to student loan debt, unless you find one who will do that for a reduced rate. Iuliano says the outcome and how much student debt is forgiven, if any, can have a lot to do with what particular judge you end up with and what the rules are in that bankruptcy district. Some of that is because of the language of the original statute stating that student loan borrowers have to meet a threshold of "undue hardship," he says. Iuliano says Congress has never defined what that means, so a lot of discretion is left up to the courts and the particular judge you get. Harrison Wadsworth, a consultant for the Consumer Bankers Association, notes that most student loans are issued by the government. But for loans from private lenders, he says relaxing the bankruptcy rules to make it easier to reduce or eliminate student debt could push up interest rates. "Lenders would have to be careful about making loans and probably have to charge more for them," Wadsworth says. Lauren eventually found a lawyer who took her case and charged her about $3,000, doing some of the work pro bono. And going through bankruptcy, she got her debt reduced from about $200,000 to around $100,000, with the bulk of that reduced to a 1% interest rate. "It's still a lot of money," she says. But she says, "I was extremely relieved." Lauren says it is significantly less than she owed before. And she says the payments are manageable. "And because they lowered the interest, I'm actually paying off the loan," she says. So she says she can recover financially, which Lawless says is what bankruptcy is there for.

 Some of the grounded Boeing 737 MAX airplanes are seen parked in Moses Lake, Wash., in October 2019. Boeing's troubled 737 Max airplane will now remain grounded from passenger service until at least June or July, which is months later than the company had  previously suggested. And that means airlines will likely cancel Max flights through the busy summer travel season. The three U.S. airlines that fly the 737 Max, American, Southwest, and United, had already removed the planes from their flight schedules into early June. In a statement, Boeing confirms that it has told its customer airlines and its manufacturing suppliers that "we are currently estimating that the ungrounding of the 737 MAX will begin during mid-2020." Industry sources tell NPR that means June or July at the earliest and ultimately, the FAA and other aviation regulators around the world will determine when the 737 Max is safe to fly passengers again, which could be months later. The 737 Max has been grounded by regulators since last March, after the second of two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people. Investigators primarily blame a faulty automated flight control system on the Max for the crashes. The company has been working on software fixes for that and other problems ever since. Until recently, Boeing had often suggested the fixes were almost ready to be submitted to regulators and approval was imminent. But in December, FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson pushed back against Boeing's then-CEO Dennis Muilenburg for suggesting repeatedly that the Max would be recertified before the end of the year, saying the regulatory agency would not be pressured into granting quick approval. Dickson summoned Muilenburg to Washington for a hastily called meeting, in which the FAA chief told the company's chief executive that "Boeing continues to pursue a return-to-service schedule that is not realistic." In a statement, the FAA said Dickson was also concerned with "the perception that some of Boeing's public statements have been designed to force FAA into taking quicker action." During the meeting, Dickson "made clear that FAA's certification requirements must be 100% complete before return to service." And "he reminded Mr. Muilenburg that FAA controls the review process" and will take all the time it needs to get the 737 Max review right. Shortly after the FAA's rebuke, Muilenburg was forced out and replaced by Boeing board member and former General Electric executive David Calhoun as CEO.   In a statement today, the FAA says "the agency is following a thorough, deliberate process to verify that all proposed modifications to the Boeing 737 MAX meet the highest certification standards. We continue to work with other safety regulators to review Boeing's work as the company conducts the required safety assessments and addresses all issues that arise during testing. We have set no timeframe for when the work will be completed." Boeing's efforts to fix the MCAS flight control system on the MAX have been plagued by setback after setback. In pushing back the anticipated date of the plane's return to service, new CEO Calhoun appears to be trying to set a new tone.  The new estimate "is informed by our experience to date with the certification process," Boeing says in its statement.   The new estimate of when the plane may finally be approved to return to service "is informed by our experience to date with the certification process," Boeing says in its statement.  "It is subject to our ongoing attempts to address known schedule risks and further developments that may arise in connection with the certification process. It also accounts for the rigorous scrutiny that regulatory authorities are rightly applying at every step of their review of the 737 MAX's flight control system," including pilot training requirements. "Returning the MAX safely to service is our number one priority, and we are confident that will happen," Boeing's statement continues. "We acknowledge and regret the continued difficulties that the grounding of the 737 MAX has presented to our customers, our regulators, our suppliers, and the flying public." The 737 Max crashes and subsequent crisis at the airplane manufacturer has been taken a toll on morale among Boeing employees and retirees in the Seattle area, where most of the company's planes are built. CEO Calhoun is in Seattle this week, meeting with Boeing employees and for the first time, he plans to take questions from reporters in a conference call Wednesday.

 Visitors in the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany view the painting Edrita Fried 1981 by Joan Mitchell. This was part of the 2015 exhibition Joan Mitchell. Retrospective. Her Life and Paintings. Art by women and men is valued differently. If a viewer thinks a painting was done by a woman, they say they like the painting less. This gender bias has real consequences for female artists -  on average, artwork by women sells for 40% less than works by men. And far less work by women is displayed in major museums around the country than work by men.  On today's show, we explore how the art world - an industry that prides itself on progressive, even radical thinking - still has a long way to go to achieve gender parity. And we bust some big myths about women artists, including why you may never have heard of the artist Joan Mitchell.  Music by Drop Electric. Find us: Twitter / Facebook / Newsletter.

 Buckshot Cunningham lived without housing for years before he moved into a small cottage at Hope Village, a shelter run by the nonprofit Rogue Retreat in southern Oregon. Chilly winds and hail don't bother Buckshot Cunningham, who lived outside without a shelter for years until he came across Hope Village in southern Oregon. "This is my umbrella," he says as he shrugs on the hood of his coat while walking into a mid-January winter storm. Hope Village is run by Rogue Retreat, a nonprofit serving low-income people in Medford, Ore., near the border with California. It's a collection of about a dozen small cottages with a communal kitchen, dining area and bathrooms. This is what housing advocates call a low-barrier shelter, with few rules and requirements to get in. There are some behavioral rules — you can't be violent or do drugs on the premises — but you don't have to be sober when you come in and you can bring your family, partner or dog. "Twelve years of drugs and alcohol" is how Cunningham says he became homeless. But there's a bit more to his story: A career as a firefighting smokejumper left him with physical disabilities. He lost his son to suicide, then his wife to cancer. "And I just went downhill from there," he says. Homelessness is often seen as an urban issue, but rural areas along the West Coast are also struggling with large homeless populations. Many of these areas don't have the resources for shelters like Hope Village, but even when they do, they're sometimes reluctant to build them. Viewed as "enabling" Just across the state border in rural Northern California, Shasta County had earned a $1.6 million grant to help fund a similar low-barrier shelter. County supervisors considered its proposal last winter when they heard from Police Chief Michael Johnson from the city of Anderson. "It is just another enabling mechanism for the homeless, the transients and the displaced people here," Johnson told the board in February 2019. "When you create something and enable people, you're going to attract more." Shasta County supervisors pushed the project back several times, citing their concerns about crime and a fear that services such as this would attract more homeless people. So Johnson proposed an alternative: a detention facility to house people who have committed low-level crimes such as public drinking, urinating in public or sleeping in public spaces, which are sometimes unavoidable for people without homes. Johnson says incarceration can be used as a tool to provide services to people who are homeless and struggling with drug addiction or mental health issues. "That's our opportunity to try to get that particular person involved in a program that will turn their life around and help them," Johnson says. "That's when they're most vulnerable, when they're the most willing to accept help and possibly agree to go into a program like that." Back in Oregon, Jackson County Sheriff Nathan Sickler has a similar sentiment. Sickler has spent the last few months advocating for a ballot measure to increase jail space at the Jackson County Jail in Medford. "Jail is a resource because when they come [to jail], there may be opportunities to become sober. And once they become sober, they tend to start to think differently," Sickler says. "Maybe they would see a benefit to taking advantage of available services." Sickler and Johnson say they don't want their rural communities to become like San Francisco or Los Angeles — overwhelmed with large homeless populations. They say providing free housing to homeless people is an urban approach, and it isn't working. Instead they emphasize law and order: bigger jails and more police officers. "Housing first" alternative Tristia Bauman of the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty disagrees with that emphasis. "That is not only an ineffective approach — it's also the single most expensive approach," she says. Bauman says "housing first" initiatives — that is, giving homes to people with few strings attached — is the best way to address homelessness. "It produces better outcomes," Bauman says. "Not only in health, but also in education. And importantly to any lawmaker: It saves communities money. In fact, it is the cheapest and most effective intervention, and that is established by a number of national studies." Similar to the shelter proposal in Shasta County, Hope Village in Oregon faced some pushback in its early stages a few years ago. Some people feared that it would increase crime and generate litter. But resident Buckshot Cunningham says those fears proved to be wrong. "Look at this place," he says, motioning to the neat row of cottages. "It's clean; it's beautiful. And it stays that way seven days a week, all year round. It's pretty simple." Cunningham has had his own room here for about four months. Now he's sober, has a girlfriend and is saving money to rent an apartment. "Getting my feet back on the ground here has enabled me to get back to society," he says. "Making me better myself. Not making me, but helping me want to."

 What if our economy is built not on traditional theories of rational behavior, but on narratives and psychology? Many people think of the economy as following a set of fairly scientific principles. We buy more if things are cheap. We buy less if they're expensive. Companies hire more people if it looks like the economy is growing. They cut back if it looks like things are going to tank. Or say you're in charge of the Federal Reserve. Economic indicators help decide whether to raise or lower interest rates. All of this seems very rational, very mathematical. But Nobel Prize winner and economist Robert Shiller suggests that this kind of thinking might be too narrow. This week on Hidden Brain, we talk with Shiller about the role stories play in our economic lives — not just the purchases we make as individuals, but the fate of entire economic systems. Then, we go further back in time to examine a story about what the world look like before money was invented. It's a story built on the idea of barter. "It goes something like this: in the beginning, before there was money, if I had something that you needed, I would approach you with that thing and see if you had anything that I needed," says anthropologist Bill Maurer. "The problem is that when we look around the world and in the historical and archaeological record for instances of this kind of direct barter, unfortunately we don't find it." Maurer challenges established ideas about the origins of currency, and highlights the connection between money and relationships. "Society is a thing of ongoing continuous relationships. The settling and unsettling of debts, on and on and on and on and on." Additional Resources Narrative Economics: How Stories Go Viral and Drive Major Economic Eventsby Robert J.

 Midlife crisis. In 2007, David Blanchflower co-authored a study with Andrew Oswald. They assembled evidence that midlife crises are real, widespread and not just made up by frustrated yuppie parents. Using data from about a half-million Americans and Europeans, Blanchflower and Oswald found that, all other things being equal, people reported happiness hitting rock bottom in their mid-to-late 40s. The study launched a cottage industry for academics and journalists, who worked to build on their findings or pick them apart.  Scholars had many objections. Blanchflower and Oswald, they said, are economists with no business invading psychologists' territory; they studied only  rich countries; their data weren't good enough. "And so that made me think, 'Well, we need to go back and redo it,' " Blanchflower says. Blanchflower has released two papers on happiness this month, and, he says, he has another one on the way.  One of his studies uses a broad range of data from 132 countries and confirms the finding from his 2007 paper. When you statistically control for things like education and employment status, happiness, he finds, is always a "U-shaped" curve over people's lifetimes. That is, it starts high in youth, then trends down and hits bottom in middle age, and picks back up in old age. This is true in all the countries he analyzes, including 95 developing nations. He finds that people are, on average, most unhappy at age 48 in developing nations and age 47 in developed ones. "The happiness curve is everywhere," he concludes.   There are many potential reasons for a midlife crisis — from the physical effects of aging to the stresses placed on breadwinning parents — but Blanchflower believes part of the reason for it is that we reach a point where it becomes clear that we won't achieve all our dreams and aspirations. At first, that's a blow. But then we realize that's OK, and we start just wanting to enjoy what time we have left. He believes this is a natural process, and he points to a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that even found a similar pattern among great apes.   In a second study, Blanchflower tries to understand why so many middle-aged adults are increasingly killing themselves, either intentionally or through drugs and alcohol, a category that economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton call "deaths of despair." Blanchflower believes this group is responding to not only the feelings of angst that come with middle age but to the lingering effects of the Great Recession. He also blames a long-term decline in social cohesion and civic engagement within communities as contributing to the problem. People feel more isolated. Blanchflower believes social support systems and health professionals can help. "The people who do OK are those with resources, health care, family, friends and good neighbors."   The good news is that the return to happiness after middle age appears to be nearly universal. Blanchflower, to take just one example, is 67 years old. He says he's happy. He's a grandfather. He spends much of his time in Florida fishing. In fact, when we spoke to him, he had just caught a 28-inch, 20-pound red fish in the Florida mangroves. He sent us a picture. Look at that blissful face, the smile of a beaming U-shaped curve.

The warnings suggest that the next phase of hostilities between the U.S. and Iran, following the Jan. 3 killing of a top Iranian general in an American drone strike, is likely to play out in cyberspace. The Iranian regime is accused of being behind some high-profile online operations against American targets in recent years. Between 2011 and 2013, hackers targeted big American banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Capital One. They flooded the banks' computer networks with traffic, knocking them offline and costing millions of dollars in lost business. In 2018, a ransomware attack crippled the city of Atlanta, leaving police officers to write reports by hand and city workers punching in and out with time clocks. In both cases, Iranian nationals were ultimately indicted. In one of the most high-profile cases, hackers destroyed data on computers at the Sands casino in Las Vegas after its billionaire owner, Sheldon Adelson, called for a nuclear strike on Iran. Iran's investment in its cyber army dates back to 2010, the year a powerful computer worm called Stuxnet infected an Iranian nuclear facility. The U.S. and Israel are believed to have been behind the attack, although neither country has ever acknowledged responsibility. Stuxnet destroyed critical equipment and set back Iran's nuclear ambitions. "As a result of the impact that Stuxnet had on the Iranian enrichment program, they formed, funded, trained and attached to their warfighting capabilities a very strong cybercapability," said Jordan Mauriello, senior vice president of managed security at cybersecurity firm CriticalStart. Stuxnet hurt Iran, but Mauriello and other experts say it also demonstrated to the country's leaders the power of digital weapons to level the playing field against the military superiority of the U.S. Iran has created teams of cyberwarriors inside the Revolutionary Guard Corps, its elite military wing. But Iran also relies on proxy groups and hackers aligned with its goals. In the weeks since a U.S. airstrike killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, nationalist "hacktivists" are suspected of defacing a U.S. government website with pro-Iran messages. Cybertools enable "asymmetric" attacks by inflicting economic or reputational damage, said Kara Frederick, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security. "Cyber allows them to compete at a level of parity that they don't have in the physical world," she said. Iran has also used these tactics against other foes, including Saudi Arabia. U.S. officials blame Iran for wiping out data on three-quarters of computers at Aramco, the kingdom's giant oil company, in 2012. While the threat of military escalation between the U.S. and Iran appears to have eased in recent days, U.S. government officials and security researchers are warning companies to be on the alert for cyberattacks. "Right now what we're seeing instead is a huge increase in reconnaissance activity," Mauriello said. "Specifically looking for potentially vulnerable servers, data gathering. ... They're kind of preparing the battle plan in the cyberspace." The new @DHSgov NTAS Bulletin on the threat landscape was issued to inform & reassure the American public, state/local governments & private partners that DHS is actively monitoring & preparing for any specific, credible threat, should one arise. pic.twitter.com/iNnHU1TI9A Earlier this month, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said agencies in his state have seen an increase in attempted computer intrusions attributed to Iran. The Department of Homeland Security has also warned that Iran may retaliate for Soleimani's death with cyberattacks ranging from defacing websites to destroying data. Iran's activities have shown its ability to cause financial harm and embarrassment. However, experts say a more serious cyber intrusion into critical U.S. infrastructure, like electrical grids, would take more time and effort. "Cyber is not a magic button, meaning that it takes many months of planning to achieve a specific outcome," said Oren Falkowitz, a former National Security Agency analyst who is the CEO of Area 1 Security. Iran is not alone in amping up its cybercapabilities. Researchers say Russia and China present the biggest threats to American targets. And the U.S. has its own digital weapons to use against adversaries. Credit:  NPR

 Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou leaves her house on her way to a court appearance on Friday in Vancouver, Canada. The U.S. government has accused Meng of fraud. Updated at 7:50 a.m. ET Tuesday The extradition hearing for Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer for the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, began Monday in Vancouver, British Columbia. American officials want Meng sent to the U.S. to face federal fraud charges. The Justice Department alleges that Meng fraudulently misled four large banks into processing "millions of dollars" worth of financial transactions with Iran in violation of international sanctions. In a 13-count indictment filed against Meng and Huawei in January 2019, the U.S. government says the scheme was conducted through a subsidiary called Skycom, a "corporation registered in Hong Kong whose primary operations were in Iran." Meng was apprehended in December 2018 as she changed planes in Vancouver. China has demanded her release, and shortly after Meng's arrest, it detained two Canadians on suspicions of espionage, a move that has been widely regarded as retaliation. The two Canadians, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, have now been in detention for more than a year. Last year, a Canadian man who had asked a Chinese court to reconsider his 15-year sentence for drug smuggling instead received a death sentence. Amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the dispute over Meng has only deepened the geopolitical friction between the world's two largest economies. When he announced the charges last year, then-acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said Huawei not only lied about its relationship with its subsidiary, but had been working to steal American telecommunications technology.  Whitaker said Huawei claimed it had sold its Iran-based unit while actually retaining control and ownership of it. As a result, the four unnamed banks doing business with Huawei had inadvertently violated U.S. restrictions on economic activity linked to Iran. Meng has denied the Justice Department's allegations. Following her arrest, her attorney, Reid Weingarten, called Meng "an ethical and honorable businesswoman who has never spent a second of her life plotting to violate any U.S. law."  Huawei has denied violating American laws and called Meng's arrest "an unlawful abuse of process — one guided by political considerations and tactics, not by the rule of law." "We trust in Canada's judicial system, which will prove Ms. Meng's innocence," the company said in a statement Monday. "Huawei stands with Ms. Meng in her pursuit for justice and freedom." Nonetheless, in March, the Canadian government said the extradition trial could proceed. When proceedings begin Monday, Meng's legal team is expected to argue that she cannot be extradited because the crime she is accused of in the United States does not constitute a crime under Canadian law. As CNBC reports, because Canada does not have economic services sanctions on Iran, Meng's legal team will argue that the nation's extradition laws do not allow for her removal. Meng, 47, is not only a top corporate officer at Huawei, but she's also the eldest daughter of its founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei. Huawei has become one of China's most important brands — and the company is seen by the U.S. government as an avenue by which China exerts global power. That's due, in part, to Huawei's work around the world to build the next generation of 5G wireless networks. Huawei has labored to reshape its image in the U.S., as the Trump administration has argued that the company's phones and technology threaten U.S. national security. Meng is free on bail and allowed limited travel but is required to wear a GPS ankle bracelet and have around-the-clock surveillance. She has spent the past year living in one of the two mansions she owns in Vancouver. In May, she was granted approval to move to the larger one — located on the same block as the U.S. consul general's residence. Last month, Huawei published an open letter from Meng on the anniversary of her arrest. "If a busy life has eaten away at my time, then hardship has in turn drawn it back out," she wrote, thanking her supporters. "Right now, time seems to pass slowly. It is so slow that I have enough time to read a book from cover to cover. I can take the time to discuss minutiae with my colleagues or to carefully complete an oil painting." The first phase of the trial is expected to last about five days, The Associated Press reports. The second phase, set to begin in June, will consider whether the FBI and Canadian police violated Meng's rights by collecting evidence during her detention — before she was arrested and informed of the crimes she allegedly committed.
Patients Still Struggle To Balance High Costs Of MS Treatment, Despite Generic,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/01/20/797477657/patients-still-struggle-to-balance-high-costs-of-ms-treatment-despite-generic,January 20, 2020,

 Generics may not have the same cost-lowering power for specialty medicines, such as multiple sclerosis drugs, researchers find. That's true especially when other brand-name drugs are approved to treat a given disease before the first generic is approved. Sometimes, the approval of a new generic drug offers more hype than hope for patients' wallets, as people with multiple sclerosis know all too well. New research shows just how little the introduction of a generic version of Copaxone — one of the most popular MS drugs — did to lower their medicine costs. MS is an autoimmune disease that gradually damages the central nervous system, disrupting communication between the brain and the rest of the body. Its symptoms are different from patient to patient across a lifetime but can include weakness, numbness, vision problems, tremors and even paralysis. There's no cure for MS, though some patients experience long remissions of symptoms. Several prescription drugs can stave off multiple sclerosis attacks and slow down the disease, says Deborah Ewing-Wilson, a neurologist with University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. But the cost of some of the most effective medicines — which have undergone frequent price hikes over the years — can put added stress on her patients. "They are extremely expensive," says Ewing-Wilson. On average, the medicines cost $70,000 per year, according to a 2017 study. Some prices have increased fivefold from when the drugs were first approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Even with insurance, says Ewing-Wilson, patients can be left on the hook for anywhere from $3,000 to more than $50,000 a year. Some patients tell her they need to skip their medications altogether because they're unaffordable. So when a generic version of the injectable MS drug Copaxone — also known as glatiramer acetate — was launched in 2015, Dan Hartung, a drug policy researcher at Oregon Health & Science University, and his colleagues thought that might spur some price relief. After all, if a cheap multiple sclerosis drug were available, wouldn't patients flock to it, forcing other manufacturers to lower their prices to compete? Hartung and his colleagues used Medicaid data to follow prices and spending on 15 multiple sclerosis drugs from 2011 through 2017. "There was a pretty minimal impact," Hartung says. Instead of forcing other prices down, the generic seems to have prompted Copaxone's price per prescription (about a month's supply of the drug) to increase by $441 "immediately," according to their study, published this month in the journal Neurology. And other multiple sclerosis drug prices continued to climb, the study found. Medicaid spending on multiple sclerosis drugs nearly tripled over the seven-year period from $453 million to $1.32 billion, according to the study. Although drugmakers pay rebates back to Medicaid, spending on these products "still more than doubled from $278 million to $600 million per year," the researchers reported. Today, the list price for a once-daily injection of Copaxone is more than $7,000 for 30 syringes, compared with $1,500 or $1,950 for the same quantity of the generic version, according to GoodRx, a website that helps patients find prescription drug costs and coupons. "Sometimes, a patient makes a decision based on cost and says, 'Oh my gosh, the drug is not on formulary' ... or 'It's going to cost me literally all my life savings,' " Ewing says, adding that she does her best to find a solution. "It's very, very sad." Hartung says he thinks he knows at least part of the reason that the generic didn't bring down costs. A year and a half before a generic for Copaxone was approved, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which makes Copaxone, introduced a new formulation of its brand-name drug. It was a higher dose of glatiramer acetate that needed to be taken less frequently. "Teva had shifted almost half of all market share from their 20-milligram version of Copaxone to the 40-milligram version of Copaxone, basically ... blunting the effect of this new generic when it went to hit the market in April 2015," Hartung said. He called it a "common tactic" employed by brand-name pharmaceutical companies to eat into generic competition. Pharmacists couldn't automatically switch patients to the generic at the pharmacy counter if they had already been taking the new version of the brand-name medicine. What's more, multiple sclerosis drugs work differently for each patient. So switching to generic Copaxone from another drug, like Tecfidera or Ocrevus, simply might not be an option. "Patients want to stay on whatever medication works for them," says Ewing-Wilson. By the end of 2017, only 36% of patients on glatiramer acetate were using the generic version, according to the study. Now, there are two manufacturers of generics, but that wasn't the case until the very end of Hartung's study. They have both since introduced 40-milligram versions of glatiramer acetate. Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University, says that Hartung and his team looked behind the curtain to see what really happens once a generic enters a "specialty" drug market. Specialty drugs tend to be expensive, complex medications that may be difficult to administer. "We're promised we'll spend less on managing diseases once a generic is available," Dusetzina says, adding that it hasn't played out that way. "We've been, really been, looking to generics for some price relief, and we're probably not going to get it as quickly as we want." Generics may not have the same cost-lowering power for specialty drugs, especially when other brand-name drugs are approved to treat a given disease before the first generic is approved, Dusetzina says. She saw a similar scenario play out, she says, when the generic version of Gleevec, a cancer drug, was approved. Still, multiple sclerosis patients may eventually see lower prices at the pharmacy counter. It usually takes four or five generics to drive prices down significantly, according to an FDA analysis. "Just because you don't see the price reduction today from the generic doesn't mean they're not coming," Dusetzina says. That's cold comfort for many MS patients who can't afford the medicine they need right now. "For any of us, this would be an issue," says Ewing-Wilson. "But particularly for people with MS who often struggle to find insurance, struggle to have affordable health care ... this is terrible. It's ghastly."
Does The China Trade Deal Move The World Away From Free Trade?,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/18/797311177/does-the-china-trade-deal-move-the-world-away-from-free-trade,January 18, 2020,

 Containers are stacked at the port in Qingdao, in China's eastern Shandong province. A new trade deal dictates that China buy more from the U.S.,  but that has other trading partners worried. The "Phase 1" trade deal with China that President Trump signed this week is unlike any previous free trade agreement. From Trump's point of view, that's the whole point. "We are righting the wrongs of the past," Trump said Wednesday during a White House signing ceremony, "and delivering a future of economic justice and security for American workers, farmers and families." But by requiring China to buy specific amounts of goods from the U.S., the deal is raising concerns that it moves away from a free-market arrangement to a more managed style of trade.  Like earlier agreements, the 96-page deal does call for lowering some trade barriers in China. It opens a door for U.S. financial services, for example, and clears the way for China to buy more American beef, dairy products, and pet food. But the agreement leaves many other trade barriers in place, including stiff tariffs on two-thirds of everything the U.S. buys from China. According to Oxford Economics, the average tariff on Chinese imports is now 19.3% — up from just 3% before the trade war began. "It's kind of a hidden tax," said Angela Carr, whose Turbie Twist company imports popular hair towels from China. "Sometimes people, because it's called a tariff, I think are led to believe that perhaps China is paying for this, when in fact the cost is going to be carried by either the consumers, the retailers or the small businesses or all three." The deal also aims to narrow the U.S. trade deficit with China by requiring that Beijing boost its purchases of U.S. goods and services by more than 50% over the next two years. "What's to me very important, number one, they're going to be spending much more than $200 billion," Trump said. The agreement sets specific targets for China to purchase a long list of farm goods, manufactured products, energy and services. "The only way for China to reach its commitments is to resort to Soviet-style managed trade," wrote Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in a blog post. Hufbauer called the purchase requirements a "worrisome and radical change," after decades in which both Republican and Democratic administrations called on China to act more like a market economy, allowing competition to drive purchasing decisions. "It is a big reversal of how the U.S. has tried to do business for the last 40 or 50 years," Hufbauer said in an interview. China sharply reduced its purchases of American farm goods during the trade war. The Phase 1 deal seeks to more than make up for that, boosting agricultural sales by $32 billion over the next two years, compared to 2017 levels. Farmers enjoyed their best sales ever to China in 2012. But Darci Vetter, who was the chief agricultural trade negotiator for the U.S. during the Obama administration, said she never tried to set a numerical target. "What U.S. farmers and ranchers told me they wanted was really the opportunity to form long-term relationships with partners in China and to do so on a market basis," Vetter said. "Trade is relationships. And we're not looking for selling a lot of products to China for the next two years. We're looking for a relationship that will endure." Some observers are skeptical that China will actually buy as much from the U.S. as the agreement calls for. At the White House signing ceremony, Vice Premier Liu He said his country's purchases would increase naturally as a result of economic growth. "As the living standard of the Chinese people rises, we will import fine-quality agricultural products from countries across the world," Liu said through an interpreter. He stressed that imports would be "based on the market demand in China." If market demand is soft, China might have to scale back purchases from other countries in order to meet its pledge to buy more from the United States. "Those countries will be very unhappy," Hufbauer said, "that China is essentially diverting its purchases which were based somewhat on market principles, to prefer U.S. exports." Trump has no qualms about the prospect of displacing China's other trading partners, including U.S. allies such as Canada or the European Union. "At long last, Americans have a government that puts them first," Trump said. The EU warned this week that Europeans could bring a complaint to the World Trade Organization if the "Phase 1" deal puts them at an unfair disadvantage. Trump's top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, said the China deal doesn't violate WTO rules or compromise any other country's trading rights. Like the president, Lighthizer prefers to negotiate with other countries one-on-one, rather than working through the international trading system that the U.S. helped to create. "If you're the biggest economy in the world, you're far better off with bilateral agreements. You've got more leverage," Lighthizer said. "If you're Switzerland, you're better off working through a group and trying to get a coalition. If you're the United States, you don't need to."

 Elk graze in Skagit Valley, an area north of Seattle, Wash., populated for centuries by Native Americans and, more recently, by farmers. Just after sunrise, elk are grazing in a misty field in Washington's Skagit Valley, an hour and a half north of Seattle. "It looks like there are roughly 40 animals there," says Scott Schuyler, a member of northwest Washington's Upper Skagit Tribe.  These elk are at the center of a conflict that's unfolding between Native Americans and farmers in northwest Washington. After being nearly wiped out in the late 1800s, the animals are making a comeback in Skagit Valley. Local tribes are thrilled, but the agricultural industry is not. Schuyler grew up in the suburbs south of Seattle, but, when a court decision reaffirmed his tribe's right to hunt and fish in the Skagit Valley, his family moved back to their ancestral home. Schuyler remembers hunting his first elk in 1987, when he was 24 years old. "I was really proud at the time," he says. "It's our tradition, when you get your first animal, you give to your community; you give to your elders. And so I gave most of the animal away." But, Schuyler says, some of the Skagit Valley's farmers and ranchers were not happy that tribal members were moving back, claiming their rights.

 Scott Schuyler is a member of the Upper Skagit tribe. He remembers hunting his first elk in 1987, when he was 24 years old. "I've had a lot of firearms pointed in my direction, a lot of lead being shot in my direction," he says. "I've been peppered with birdshot." He says he's had his tires slashed, his fish stolen. He's gotten death threats on social media. Schuyler's tribe and others are sovereign nations that have treaties with the US government that date back to the mid-1800s. Those treaties guarantee their right to hunt, fish and gather. The treaties also grant them a role in fish and wildlife management. But Schuyler says some residents and some public officials don't think the tribe should have those rights. "And [so] it becomes socially acceptable to attack the tribe, tribal members and tribes' rights," he says. Elk damage farms Not far from where the elk grazed in a pasture in the early morning, Eileen and Randy Good have worked as dairy farmers and cattle ranchers for more than four decades. The Goods both grew up in Skagit Valley. Now, Eileen Good says, the elk are "making it impossible for us to survive as a farmer." She says the elk knock down fences, eat up pastures and destroy crops. "I figure we have lost like $36,000 a year due to the elk crossing and wrecking the fences all the time," Randy Good says. He points to a Skagit County Assessor's report that says elk are causing $1.4 million of damage in the valley every year. That number relies on farmers self-reporting the damage, but no one doubts the loss is real and widespread. Bill Schmidt is president of the Skagit Valley Farm Bureau. He objects to any tribal involvement in elk management. 
                Randy and Aileen Good have farmed in Skagit Valley for four decades. They say elk have damaged their farm and farm equipment.

 Randy and Aileen Good have farmed in Skagit Valley for four decades. They say elk have damaged their farm and farm equipment. "I mean, it's like one percent or less of our population is controlling the management of the elk," he says, "and it doesn't seem right." Historians say Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest have hunted elk for thousands of years. Still, Schmidt maintains white settlers in the early 1900s said there weren't many Native Americans in Skagit Valley. And those who were there, he says, "They were not into deer and elk. They were basically fishermen." Historians say that claim is incorrect. But, for Schmidt, this is about something beyond the specifics of deer and elk and fish. "They're claiming all these rights because it's an easy way to have extra rights," he says. "I think they should be more forthright and try and be — to me — more American." The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife is trying to bridge the divide by keeping elk away from farms, reimbursing farmers for losses and shooting problematic animals. Wildlife officials will be spending the next three months counting and collaring the Skagit Valley's elk. Their goal is to minimize conflict while also growing the herd to a more robust population. Tribal member Scott Schuyler says compromise is difficult because of the pervasive belief that neither elk nor tribes belong in the valley. "We made this deal with the United States," Schuyler says. "It was like, 'OK, well, you're giving up your land, but, you know what? We'll let you continue fishing and hunting.'" "Those same rights are under attack."

 The Diner, which is a project of Meals on Wheels People in Vancouver, Wash., provides community in addition to meals for seniors enrolled in the program. Usually Meals on Wheels means home delivery or lunch at a senior center. For more than 50 years, the federal government has been funding the program to make sure older Americans get the nutrition they need. Now, a project in Vancouver, Wash., is trying to use those funds for something new: a retro-hip diner, where seniors can get eggs, coffee, and community.  On the surface, The Diner looks like any other diner. Servers making sure the coffee is topped off, local business people having meetings, regulars who know the whole menu. There are the usual diner specialties, with some modern nods — cage-free eggs and local produce — and a retro vibe. "They play Frank Sinatra in the mornings, and it makes me so happy," says Autumn Zukauskus, who comes for breakfast weekly. "Eggs and Frank Sinatra: perfect breakfast." But when a younger patron like Zukauskus reaches for her credit card, seniors like Chris Bingenheimer pull out a little green dining card.  "If you can donate, you do. If you don't, you don't," Bingenheimer explains. "And it's no big deal to them." That's because the entire diner is a project of the local organization Meals on Wheels People. If you look closer, you'll notice a few differences from other restaurants. The chairs are on casters, to scoot out easily if they need to make space for a wheelchair. The coffee cups have large handles, to accommodate arthritic fingers. The building and finishes were designed and selected to minimize noise and maximize comfort. Avoiding stigma Suzanne Washington is the CEO of Meals on Wheels People, which serves about 5,000 meals a day. Most of these are home delivery, and about a third are in senior centers. But people don't always want to go to a senior center. "We heard lots of folks say it was just too much of a stigma to go," Washington says.  Some baby boomers think senior centers are just for their grandparents. Or they're still working, and can't get away for lunch. So, Washington thought, 'Why not try a restaurant?' "A restaurant that is inter-generational. It's good food," says Washington. "And at the same time, the paying public can help offset the cost of those in our program." There's a slightly different menu for participating seniors — like an added fruit cup or a glass of milk — to meet nutritional requirements. And some regular menu items aren't part of the program. "Because we can never make eggs benedict meet regulations," Washington says. "It just doesn't work."

 The Diner in Vancouver, Wash.,  serves seniors and non-seniors alike. The menu for those who qualify for Meals on Wheels meets federal nutrition standards. Full menu But the menu is still delicious, and the diner's been averaging 140 subsidized meals each month. They've signed up an average of 38 new members per month — about three times the number that sign up for Meals on Wheels at their traditional senior centers. And those who come for the meal donate more for it — the average donation is $2.46, which is four times higher than the donation at a senior center. And for an organization that provides 1.2 million senior meals annually, every increase is significant.  New sign-ups also get a visit from a client service coordinator, who does assessments, and checks if seniors need to be connected to additional services — the sort of information that they might have found at a traditional senior center. The decline in participation at traditional senior centers isn't just a problem in the Pacific Northwest.  "It is a national trend, where many senior centers are witnessing declining participation rates," explains Manoj Pardasani, a provost and professor of social work at Hunter College. Providing engagement  Pardasani says the decline is due to a number of factors: centers that haven't innovated to reflect the diversity of the population, or people who look down on senior centers as something only for "needy" people. And he says the downturn is concerning, because these centers provide far more than just food. They provide community engagement, and combat isolation, which provides a benefit for mental and emotional health. "The core belief behind meals is the socialization aspect," says Pardasani. "We're human beings, we've been socialized to be social animals."  And The Diner is a social place. You can see it in the customers joking with the staff, the people who bring in an older neighbors, the seniors who carpool together for a meal. Young people like Amber Zukauskus come for that camaraderie just as much as for the little pies. "Everyone here is so nice," says Zukauskus. "And they pay everybody a living wage, and so all your tips just go to donations for Meals on Wheels, which is amazing. That's something I want to give money to." The Diner has gone through the usual hiccups of starting a new restaurant — dealing with staffing, figuring out the lunch rush, adjusting portion size so that seniors might have some extra to take home and eat later. Meals on Wheels People received some grant money to help with start up costs, and they expect to turn a profit in their third year. But even early on, they seem to be hitting their stride. It's a bustling, thriving business. Chris Bingenheimer learned about The Diner from a friend, and came in to share a meal. He sometimes goes to a senior center, but was never a fan of the made-in-advance food, or the minimal choices, or of the fact he had to be called up for a meal like at the high school cafeteria. He said he'll definitely be back to The Diner. "The staff is very friendly," says Bingenheimer. "They don't look down on you because you're with the Meals on Wheels program. They treat you kindly. The service is impeccable." Bingenheimer is a senior using Meals on Wheels. And at The Diner, he's also just a guy, sitting with a friend, having a good breakfast. 
Amtrak Asks 2 People Who Use Wheelchairs To Pay $25,000 For A Ride,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/17/797355136/amtrak-asks-two-people-in-wheelchairs-to-pay-25-000-for-a-ride,January 17, 2020,

 A member of the station staff pushes a portable wheelchair lift along the platform at an Amtrak station in DeLand, Fla. The company says its policies for having to adjust or remove seats has changed. Updated at 11 a.m. ET on Jan. 20  It costs just $16 to buy a one-way ticket on the Amtrak train from Chicago to Bloomington, Ill., unless you're the two people who use wheelchairs and tried to buy tickets recently. They were told their tickets will cost not $16 — but $25,000. When Adam Ballard saw what Amtrak wanted to charge, he couldn't believe it. "I thought it was a mistake. That's the price of a car," Ballard says. "How can that be possible? I was sure it was a mistake. But I've seen it in writing. So I know it's not." Ballard works for a disability service and advocacy center in Chicago called Access Living. He is its housing and transportation policy analyst, and a group from his office is headed to Bloomington next Wednesday for a work retreat. There are 10 of them, and five — including Ballard — use wheelchairs. Their train has three cars. Each car has one space for a wheelchair. That makes three spaces for five people in wheelchairs. In the past, when Access Living gave advance notice that it was sending a large group, Amtrak took out more seats to fit more wheelchairs. Once, it took out seats in the dining car and charged a few hundred dollars extra. "I use a power wheelchair. It is standard size for a power chair, but it's larger than most manual chairs. So I take up a little extra space," Ballard says. "But always in the past, no matter what kind of assortment of people and devices we had together for our group, it was never a problem to get everybody on board." 
                Adam Ballard, the housing and transportation policy analyst at the nonprofit Access Living, says Amtrak wanted to charge his organization more than $25,000 to take the train from Chicago to Bloomington, Ill.

 Adam Ballard, the housing and transportation policy analyst at the nonprofit Access Living, says Amtrak wanted to charge his organization more than $25,000 to take the train from Chicago to Bloomington, Ill. But not this time. On Dec. 30, an Amtrak agent for group sales based in Philadelphia wrote: "I received a cost regarding the removal of seats and I've been advised this will be over $25 K. Would you like for me to proceed with the request?" Someone from the group wrote back: "Am I reading this correctly?" The answer came back on Jan. 2. "The cost is correct," the agent wrote, citing a new policy for taking out those seats. The agent explained that it's expensive to take out extra seats and that it means taking a car out of service. "With removal of seats, it can be quite costly," the agent wrote. "In previous years, the removal of seats from the coach cars incurred fees that Amtrak absorbed ... We understand and appreciate your loyalty with Amtrak. Going forward, we cannot continue to absorb these fees. These polices have changed nationwide as of 2019." Officials at Access Living then reached out to senior officials at Amtrak asking for a "return to the prior arrangement," according to Bridget Hayman, director of communications for Access Living. She says Amtrak officials agreed to "present the situation to upper management" and give the disability group an answer by Jan. 13. But there was no response by the promised deadline, Hayman says, and then no communication when officials at Access Living tried to follow up. Jonathan Mook is an attorney who advises companies about their obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA. He was surprised by the $25,000 figure.  "The $25,000 ... that's a Hobson's choice. It's no choice at all. Obviously, the group can't pay $25,000," Mook says. The ADA, which became law 30 years ago this year, is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in jobs, schools, public places and transportation — including trains. It requires companies like Amtrak to make "reasonable accommodations" so that people with disabilities have comparable access to transportation as do people without disabilities. The law says a business can get an exemption from the requirement to make an accommodation if doing so would require an "undue burden" on the company. Mook, who is with the Virginia-based law firm DiMuro Ginsberg, says that's mostly a protection for small businesses, or maybe for a big project — like a renovation that adds ramps and elevators to a historic train station. Still, he says, it's a "gray area" in the law to determine how much money a company is required to spend. But even if it really costs Amtrak $25,000 to take a train car out of service and pull up the seats, Mook says, "that doesn't end the story ... [Amtrak] has to reach out and say, 'Let's talk about some alternatives here. What can we devise?' "  That is what it did with Access Living in the past. NPR contacted Amtrak several times. One spokesperson noted that the policy about reconfiguring seats is not directed at people with disabilities but applies to anyone who makes a request that requires "removing seating or making other physical changes to the service." The official referred NPR to a page on Amtrak's website. It doesn't mention a new policy for people with disabilities or pulling up seats. At the top of the page it says: "Amtrak is happy to provide accessible transportation to all of our guests." In fact, many wheelchair users — like Adam Ballard — prefer trains to buses and airplanes. "We've looked at other options, like buses," Ballard says. "And nothing compares to Amtrak." On the train, the bathrooms are spacious, large enough to fit a wheelchair. And Ballard can stay in his wheelchair, instead of checking it like luggage — and then worrying that this expensive piece of equipment that is hard to fix and crucial to his mobility — will be damaged. Ballard still plans to go to the meeting next week. Access Living is using one of its vans to take him and a colleague. The other eight people in the group will buy those $16 one-way tickets on the train. For $25,000, they could buy more than 1,500 tickets. After publication of the NPR story, Amtrak released a statement reiterating its earlier comments that the charges were part of the company's policy to charge passengers "an additional fee when any group requires reconfiguration of our railcars."  The statement went on to say: "We will contact Access Living and suggest costs could be avoided by using the two separate trains on this route, with each train separated by about three hours and having three spaces for wheelchairs without any reconfiguration. We will also confirm the pricing for a railcar reconfiguration given to this important and valued customer." On Sunday, Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, an Iraq War veteran and double amputee, said in a series of tweets that she was disappointed that Amtrak "appears to have failed to offer a public apology for its initial mistake." "The Americans with Disabilities Act has been the law of the land for 30 years," she said. "Yet in 2020, @Amtrak believes it would be an unreasonable burden to remove architectural barriers that would enable a group with five wheelchair users to travel together." Duckworth, who is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Transportation and Safety, went on to say she planned to request a meeting with Amtrak President and CEO Richard Anderson "to discuss eliminating Amtrak's nationwide policy of refusing to absorb any costs associated with reconfiguring a railcar to accommodate a group of wheelchair users."

 Economist Gabriela Saade (left) presents Stacey Vanek Smith with a purse made entirely out of Venezuelan bolívares. 2019 was shaping up to be another horrific year for Venezuela. For the last five years, the country has been in a kind of economic death spiral. In fact, 2019 started out with nationwide blackouts, crippling inflation, food shortages and one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. But things have stabilized a little bit over the last year. According to Venezuelan economist, Gabriela Saade, the reason has little to do with the country's authoritarian regime and everything to do with the innovation and resilient spirit of everyday citizens.

The Cost Of Free: Casper Pays A Price For Generous Mattress Returns,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/17/797100231/the-cost-of-free-casper-pays-a-price-for-generous-mattress-returns,January 17, 2020,

 Casper changed mattress shopping with the promise of a 100-night "risk-free" trial and easy returns. Now the cost of those returns is being scrutinized as the online company prepares to go public. There's no free lunch, economists will say. So when a company says, sleep on a mattress for a few months and return it for free — that actually costs money. Just how much? That question is now in the spotlight as online mattress seller Casper plans to go public. The decision forced Casper to disclose eye-popping losses: more than $92 million in 2018. This has become a familiar story of a startup. Casper is a dominant online brand that's growing faster than its peers, according to Rakuten Intelligence. And it's investing heavily in marketing and opening physical stores. But another big cost at Casper is "refunds, returns and discounts," worth almost $81 million in 2018. "This was long suspected that Casper is losing money," said David Perry, executive editor and mattress writer at Furniture Today. "The number I really would like to see is what is the return percentage [of Casper's mattresses]. Spoiler alert: I'm still looking." The company did not disclose how many of its mattresses get returned. It also did not respond to NPR's inquiry. "My educated guess is that Casper's return rate would put it somewhere in the 12% to 14% rate," said Michael Magnuson of GoodBed.com, who's done detailed analysis of industry costs. That would mean roughly 1 out of 8 Casper mattresses might be sent back. That's pretty average for an online purchase — with one major difference. "Unlike those shoes that you send back," Magnuson said, "this mattress that you're not going to keep — will never be resold." Casper wasn't the first company to sell mattresses on the Internet. And it wasn't the first to squish giant bedding into a box for cheaper shipping. Casper's success story was about changing how people think about shopping for a mattress, persuading them to buy an item they'd sleep on for years sight unseen. The free trial of "100 nights risk-free" and a generous returns policy were two of Casper's most revolutionary moves. "Essentially, mattresses are layers of foam, or they're layers of foam and springs. And they're a blind purchase; you can't look inside the mattress," Perry said. "One of the key differentiators in the online space is the marketing." And Casper founders spent hundreds of millions of dollars on marketing — all with their stated goal of becoming "the Nike of sleep." They drew in celebrity investors like rapper Nas and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. They flooded podcasts, websites and the New York subway with quirky, punny ads. They launched mediation audio streaming, "nap mobiles" and $25 45-minute naps at "The Dreamery" in New York, a magnet for YouTubers and Instagrammers — whose posts create free social promotion. Before Casper, few mattress companies did free returns. "They came up with the innovation that said we're going to donate it — we're going to eat the costs entirely," Magnuson said. Casper co-founder Neil Parikh told Inc. in a 2016 interview that the company tries to donate returned mattresses to local charities, "which is more cost-effective than taking them back halfway across the country to refurbish and resell." In its filing to go public, Casper addressed the issue of returns, saying: "As a young company, we are still learning about the factors affecting customer returns and believe we have the opportunity to reduce customer return rates. We have identified several opportunities that span policy change, process improvement and consumer education to reduce return rates and increase overall customer satisfaction." Companies aren't allowed to sell used mattresses as new. And, of course, donations offer a bit of a tax write-off. But these days, there are 175 online mattress brands in Casper's wake, according to Perry. Many have replicated Casper's generous returns policy. "Given all the mattresses that are being sold online, the donation ecosystem is feeling pretty full, I think, at the moment," Magnuson said. He says he has been concerned lately as more and more people write to him, for example: "I've tried these three mattresses, and none of them have worked." "That could literally mean," Magnuson says, "that essentially four mattresses got made — three of which theoretically could have ended up in a landfill — just to get that one household the mattress that they want." As Casper prepares its initial public stock offering, it's likely to continue facing the question of whether this problem keeps its executives up at night. Editor's note: Casper is one of NPR's financial supporters.
In China, Birthrate Falls To Lowest Level In 70 Years,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/17/797230518/in-china-gdp-growth-falls-to-lowest-level-in-nearly-30-years,January 17, 2020,

 A woman carries a baby born on China's National Day, Oct. 1, 2019, at a hospital in Chengdu, China. Experts say that once-strict government restrictions on births is likely to place a burden on the country's economy. Updated at 9 a.m. ET New birthrate figures show that China has so far failed to reverse the effects of its longtime one-child policy — a change that policymakers say is necessary to forestall the long-term economic consequences of an aging and shrinking population. The National Bureau of Statistics of China released the new data on Friday, the same day it announced that the country's GDP growth has fallen to its lowest level in nearly 30 years. Last year, there were 10.48 births per 1,000 people, the lowest birthrate since 1949, the year the People's Republic of China was founded. The number was down from 10.94 the year before. The one-child policy was put in place in 1979 by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who feared that the country's exploding population would hold back economic development. However, by 2016, China's leadership came to realize that the policy had been too successful and officially relaxed it. Experts say that improved education and higher incomes in China have led to delayed marriage and childbirth and that once-strict government restrictions on births have made one-child households the norm. "China should have stopped the policy 28 years ago. Now it's too late," Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and a longtime critic of the country's family-planning policies, told The Guardian last year. By 2050, a third of China's people will be 60 or older, according to current projections, placing a significant burden on the government to care for the elderly. Tariffs pinch economic growth Meanwhile, the world's second-largest economy cooled to its slowest pace in nearly three decades, with China posting year-on-year growth of 6.1% last year — a further sign that the protracted trade war with the U.S. has taken a toll. The pace of growth in gross domestic product for 2019 was down from 6.6% the previous year and marked the smallest annual increase since 1990.

 A crane lifts a shipping container from China onto a terminal at the Port of Savannah in Georgia. China's economy grew by just 6.1% last year, a sign that the trade war with the U.S. has taken a toll. Beijing's policymakers had projected growth of between 6% and 6.5% for the year. China's GDP, worth an estimated $14.4 trillion, is second in size only to that of the U.S. Its economy has been undergoing a painful shift away from heavy industry and commodities. Instead, Beijing has aimed for a more consumer-based economy. The latest GDP figures, while exceptionally strong by the standards of many other countries, are a long way from the heady days of 10% or more growth barely a decade ago. In 2007, the Chinese economy grew by a blistering 14%. In recent years, China's leaders have struggled to balance competing demands of maintaining high rates of growth while simultaneously minimizing the consequences of years of debt-fueled stimulus spending. Last year, authorities took steps to limit wasteful infrastructure investments in an effort to rein in unsustainable levels of local government and corporate debt. Friday's data come days after a "Phase 1" trade deal between the U.S. and China, seen as a step toward ending an 18-month-old trade dispute, which has seen damaging tariffs imposed by both sides. The new trade deal eases U.S. tariffs on some popular consumer goods manufactured in China, such as cellphones, but leaves in place hundreds of billions of dollars of other tariffs, including on components that U.S. factories use to assemble finished products.

 Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during the unveiling of the Tesla Model Y in Hawthorne, Calif., on March 14, 2019. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has always had ambitious goals. Make electric cars cool, save the world, all while making money as a brand new car manufacturer.  And from the start some people have been confident that he would fail. So they shorted Tesla stock — placing a bet that the company's stock value would collapse. So far, that has been a phenomenally bad bet.  In the first two weeks of 2020 alone, short sellers were down some $2.6 billion, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, the head of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.  "It's not a happy new year for Tesla short sellers," he says.  Tesla stock debuted at less than $20 a share in 2010. It hit $200 in 2014. And now, after strong deliveries in the fourth quarter and the successful launch of a new factory in China, it's above $500 — giving the company the highest valuation of any U.S. carmaker ever.  Dusaniwsky says that since 2016, Tesla short sellers are down $11.1 billion.  "We've lost a lot of money," says Mark Spiegel, the head of a small hedge fund that placed a very large bet against Tesla.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here.  Spiegel's fund lost more than $1 million from shorting Tesla, which he started doing back in 2014. This week, he began cutting back. "[It was] at 20% of the fund, sometimes a third of the fund, and I slashed it back today because [the stock price] is just so decoupled from reality," he said on Monday. "I am the world's worst predictor of Tesla's stock price," he said. But he's far from the only one. Most companies don't have investors betting against them like this, and when they do it's normal for 3% to 8% of a company's stock to be shorted, according to Dusaniwsky. At the start of 2020, more than 20% of Tesla stock was shorted. As of Jan. 15, it's the single most-shorted stock on the U.S. market. Some major hedge funds are among the most active short sellers. Musk seems to take this personally. He once called short sellers "jerks who want us to die," and he's tussled with prominent short sellers on Twitter.  He's also repeatedly warned them that they're making a bad bet — once saying a "tsunami of pain" was coming for those who bet against the company. And he's repeatedly been right.  'Cultish convictions on both sides' Dusaniwsky says the community of Tesla short sellers is unusual — not just for its size, but for its passion. Meanwhile, Tesla also has a highly energetic community of superfans and Elon Musk enthusiasts.  "It's not just a financial transaction," Dusaniwsky says. "It's almost a lifestyle choice to be on one side or the other." There's a very public battle between the two sides, waged on Twitter, podcasts, YouTube channels and the business press.  The Tesla fans say Musk is a genius and a visionary, who's made droolworthy, eco-friendly cars with cutting-edge autonomous technology. And sales are through the roof, they point out.  The Tesla shorts, like Spiegel, say Musk is an erratic fraud. They say Tesla's Autopilot technology is dangerous or even "homicidal," and that the company's sales rely on subsidies that will eventually run out.  "There is strong conviction on both sides. More than strong. There's cultish convictions on both sides," Dusaniwsky says. "It's almost like a college football game ... people are just crazy fans and it doesn't matter what the team does." His data shows some short sellers are finally backing away from their investments as Tesla's remarkable rally continues. Forty percent of all the short sales of Tesla stock have been closed out since June 30, 2019. That means major losses, given Tesla's stock market surge. But it still leaves a lot of investors holding on. "They're just staying in a position no matter what," Dusaniwsky says.  Even Spiegel, who has reduced the size of his position, hasn't changed his mind about the company's future.  He still says the stock prices will collapse — eventually.  Just like he's been saying for years.  "Obviously we've been way too early on the timing," Spiegel says. "But you never know that in advance."

 Boeing 737 Max aircraft operated by Southwest Airlines crowd the tarmac of the airport in Victorville, Calif., after the Federal Aviation Administration grounded the planes last year. A pair of Boeing 737 Max 8 jetliners plummeted from the sky in 2018 and 2019, killing hundreds of passengers and eventually prompting officials to ground the aircraft model worldwide — but the process that allowed the craft in the air in the first place is generally sound, according to a review commissioned by U.S. regulators. An independent committee established by the Department of Transportation published its findings in a 68-page report Thursday. (Skip down to read the whole report.) And broadly, the group found the certification process laid out by the Federal Aviation Administration to be effective, with some changes needed for improvement. "What we saw was a thorough work by aviation professionals," one of the two co-chairs, former Air Line Pilots Association President Lee Moak, told journalists on a conference call explaining the findings. Together with retired Air Force Gen. Darren McDew, Moak oversaw a five-member panel with a mix of transportation industry executives and former regulators. "However," Moak added, "we saw where you could improve the system." Among their recommendations for the FAA: What was not among its recommendations was any significant adjustment to the FAA's Organization Designation Authorization, a program by which the agency can delegate elements of its certification process to certain approved private individuals or companies. The program drew controversy last year when lawmakers questioned how Boeing ended up being responsible for reviewing changes to its own design on the 737 Max. "Safety experts have long raised concerns that the [ODA] program leaves the fox in charge of the henhouse," Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., wrote in a letter to the Department of Transportation last March, just days after the FAA grounded the Max.  "In short," he added, "the staff responsible for regulating aircraft safety are answerable to the manufacturers who profit from cutting corners, not the American people who may be put at risk." Further concern surfaced last week with the revelation that Boeing employees had mocked the FAA in internal messages and gloated about the ease with which the plane was approved. "This airplane," read one note about the craft, which would later be involved in the deaths of 346 people, "is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys."

 The mother of a victim of the Ethiopian Airlines crash, which killed scores of passengers last year, bears a sign representing the dead passengers before a congressional hearing on the Boeing 737 Max 8 back in June. But in its review, the panel found no evidence that the outcome of the certification process would have been different if the FAA had not delegated some of the steps. "The FAA's delegation system is an appropriate and effective tool for conducting aircraft certification," the committee concluded in the executive summary of its report. "It relies on effective standards, oversight and communication between stakeholders." The review isn't the first to be compiled since the aircraft was grounded. Last October, an FAA-commissioned panel known as the Joint Authorities Technical Review lambasted both the agency and Boeing for failing to properly evaluate the new automated flight control system that directly caused the crashes. The Justice Department and Transportation Department's Office of Inspector General also are investigating the Boeing plane's certification. The airline manufacturing giant — now helmed by CEO David Calhoun after Dennis Muilenburg stepped down from the post last month — responded to Thursday's report with gratitude and a commitment to take its findings seriously. "We will study these recommendations closely," a company spokesperson said in a brief statement, "as we continue to work with government and industry stakeholders to enhance the certification process."  The FAA also welcomed the report's findings. "I was pleased to see that the committee recommended we advance the use of Safety Management Systems throughout all sectors of the aviation industry,"  Administrator Steve Dickson said in a statement released by the FAA. "The agency will carefully consider the committee's work, along with the recommendations identified in various investigative reports and other analyses, as we take steps to enhance our aircraft certification processes."

Microsoft Pledges To Remove From The Atmosphere All The Carbon It Has Ever Emitted,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/16/796758230/microsoft-pledges-to-remove-from-the-atmosphere-all-the-carbon-its-ever-emitted,January 16, 2020,

 Microsoft has announced new, more ambitious climate change targets for the coming decades. Microsoft has announced an ambitious plan to not just reduce its carbon emissions, but to actively remove carbon from the atmosphere — going "carbon negative" by 2030.  And by 2050, the tech giant pledges it will "remove from the environment all the carbon the company has emitted either directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975." As the world faces the increasingly dire effects of climate change, which is caused by greenhouse gas emissions, a growing number of companies have pledged to reduce their carbon emissions.  It's much rarer to pledge to go carbon negative; in that, Microsoft is joining Ikea and a handful of much smaller companies. And vowing to remove all the emissions the company ever released is even more unusual.  "I've never seen that before," says Cynthia Cummis, the director of private sector climate mitigation at the World Resources Institute. Cummis says that Microsoft's commitment is also noteworthy for its level of detail.  The company already pushes employees to consider emissions while making business decisions. Microsoft says it will adapt that policy to reduce emissions not just within the company but also across its entire supply chain. It says it will cut its own emissions to "near zero" by using 100% renewable energy and relying on electric vehicles.  "They're going to decarbonize at a very fast rate and then [use] carbon removals to balance out those remaining emissions," Cummis says. "That's what's in line with science and what we want to see all companies doing."  Extinction Rebellion UK, a climate change activist group, called Microsoft's announcement "an important step in the right direction." The group added: "Who will follow next?" Removing — not just avoiding — carbon emissions Microsoft, which is one of NPR's sponsors, says it has been "carbon neutral" for years by reducing emissions and paying for offsets for what remained. But those offsets, while they may have kept new carbon dioxide from being released, did not usually involve taking existing emissions out of the atmosphere. The company's new policy will place a much stronger emphasis on such carbon removal.  "Neutral is not enough to address the world's needs," Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in the announcement Thursday.  Planting trees is one way to actively remove carbon from the atmosphere. Higher-tech strategies are also being researched, including direct air capture: pulling carbon out of the atmosphere and putting it in storage. "It's not a new technology," says David Goldberg, a Columbia University research professor who studies carbon removal and storage. Small-scale installations are active now. But "scaling that technology up to where it could be very, very effective and viable for a large-scale capture and storage ... that's earlier in the development phase," Goldberg says. Microsoft is pledging to create a $1 billion fund to invest in developing such technology, similar to other climate-focused funds (including one spearheaded by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates). Some environmental groups have long been skeptical of climate pledges that rely heavily on carbon removal. They've argued that such plans allow companies to avoid reducing their emissions, instead emitting carbon today while pledging to remove it — somehow — in the future.  But there's growing consensus that carbon removal technology, paired with dramatic reductions in emissions, will be essential for any successful fight against climate change. "There are a lot of emissions up in the atmosphere already, unfortunately," says Paula DiPerna, an expert on climate change mitigation. "I think the emphasis on removal is welcome." In announcing the new climate change goals, Microsoft is not backing away from its work with oil and gas companies. Instead, it argues that oil and gas companies need to "meet today's business demands" while working to transition toward a zero-carbon future.   Greenpeace, while welcoming Microsoft's announcement overall, said the continued work with fossil fuel companies is "a gaping hole" in Microsoft's climate plan.  Microsoft says it will publicly track its progress toward its goals. That's a "key element of any program like this that seeks to make significant emissions reductions," says Nancy Meyer, the vice president for business engagement at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. "You have to show how those activities and initiatives are resulting in real reductions."  She also says it's critical for companies to advocate for changes in public policy. Meanwhile, in the absence of federal action on climate, pledges like Microsoft's are significant, Meyer says. "It leads the way for other businesses to start making their own really ambitious goals like this," she says. 
Senate OKs North American Trade Deal To Replace NAFTA, Giving Trump A Much-Needed Win,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/16/796901909/senate-oks-north-american-trade-deal-to-replace-nafta-giving-trump-a-much-needed,January 16, 2020,

 From left, then-Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau participate in a USMCA signing ceremony in November 2018 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Updated at 7:28 p.m. ET  The Senate overwhelmingly approved a revised North American trade pact in a rare bipartisan vote Thursday that hands President Trump a victory on a key campaign promise just as lawmakers are preparing his impeachment trial. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, passed by a vote of 89-10. The trade pact, signed by the president in November 2018, received a similar bipartisan vote in the House last month. A statement by the White House press secretary called the measure "another trade win for American workers," replacing "the job-killing, huge failure NAFTA."  "USMCA, which the President successfully negotiated over a year ago, rebalances trade between the three countries and will lead to significant economic and job growth in the United States," the statement said. Individual senators touted the benefits of the new agreement for their own constituents, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who called it "a major win for Kentucky and all 50 states."  Speaking from the Senate floor on Wednesday, he added that the deal is "a major win for our country. A major win for the Trump administration."  The USMCA is meant to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, negotiated in the 1990s by President George H.W. Bush and pushed through Congress by President Bill Clinton. With a renegotiated trade pact with Mexico and Canada and the signing on Wednesday of an initial trade deal with China aimed at winding down a long and bitter trade war, Trump can say he has fulfilled his pledge to get tough on trade and eliminate "bad deals" made by his predecessors. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., in tweet said the agreement will boost trade throughout the state and serve the interests of "farmers, manufacturers, and businesses."  Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said it "gives a 21st-century update to our trading policies with Mexico and Canada. Meanwhile, Trump's reelection campaign took a swing at presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who was one of 10 lawmakers who voted against USMCA.  "Socialist Bernie Sanders just proudly voted AGAINST new jobs and higher wages for Americans workers," the Trump campaign wrote in an email to supporters on Thursday.  "Sanders is willing to sacrifice blue-collar jobs and better wages, even as he enjoys flying fossil fuel burning private jets on an almost daily basis," the email added.   Many economists argue that NAFTA was a substantial boost to North American economies, removing trade barriers, reducing tariffs and increasing foreign investment, particularly in Mexico. Critics, including Trump and many Democrats, say NAFTA sent U.S. jobs across the border. The president has frequently maligned NAFTA as "perhaps the worst trade deal ever made." But a 2017 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service concluded that the impact of NAFTA over a quarter-century was difficult to isolate. "A major challenge in assessing NAFTA is separating the effects that came as a result of the agreement from other factors. U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada was already growing prior to NAFTA and it likely would have continued to do so without an agreement," it said. "In reality, NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters," the report said. The new agreement does offer some modest benefits over the previous pact. According to a report last year by the U.S. International Trade Commission, USMCA would boost gross domestic product by 0.35% after inflation, or $68.2 billion, creating 175,700 new jobs over six years, fewer on average than the U.S. economy creates in a single month. "U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico would increase by $19.1 billion (5.9 percent) and $14.2 billion (6.7 percent), respectively. U.S. imports from Canada and Mexico would increase by $19.1 billion (4.8 percent) and $12.4 billion (3.8 percent), respectively," according to the report. One key feature would raise the percentage of a vehicle's parts that must be produced in North America to avoid tariffs from 62.5% under the old NAFTA to 75% under the USMCA. The new pact would also require most of those parts to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour — a provision designed to offset cheap Mexican labor. The ITC report said that the changes would lead to a small increase in the retail price of vehicles. The White House also negotiated a reduction in Canadian tariffs on U.S. dairy products, including milk powder and baby formula. But Canada accomplished one of its top priorities: saving Chapter 19, a dispute resolution mechanism that allows any country to challenge another's trade restrictions before a neutral arbitrating body. The best-known Chapter 19 cases under NAFTA involve disputes between Canada and the U.S. over softwood lumber and between the U.S. and Mexico over washing machines. "Canada's negotiating position at the very least was significantly strengthened by the determinations it was getting under the Chapter 19 process," Matthew Kronby, a trade lawyer with Borden Ladner Gervais in Toronto, told Reuters. Democrats used the renegotiated pact to push their own agenda, winning stronger enforcement of labor and environmental protections and managing to cut out a provision that would have granted long-term patent protection to pharmaceutical companies. "We're declaring victory for the American worker," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last month. "It is infinitely better than what was initially proposed by the administration." The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., called the USMCA "a new construct for trade." Importantly, the USMCA was supported by organized labor. Speaking last month, AFL-CIO leader Richard Trumka said that while USMCA "isn't a perfect agreement," it was "well on its way to getting there." On the 2020 presidential campaign trail, Democratic hopefuls expressed some disagreement over the new pact. During Tuesday night's debate, Sanders insisted, "We could do much better than a Trump-led trade deal." Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren described the deal as a "modest improvement," adding that "Sen. Sanders himself said so." "It will give some relief to our workers," Warren said. "I believe we accept that relief, we try to help the people who need help, and we get up the next day and fight for a better trade deal." The new deal also includes provisions to protect the ozone layer, marine environment and air quality, and it establishes a fisheries management system to prevent overfishing in North American waters. But that hasn't been enough to satisfy environmental groups. In a joint statement last month, the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters and the Natural Resources Defense Council urged its members to oppose the USMCA. They said the new trade deal doesn't go nearly far enough and "would encourage further outsourcing of pollution and jobs, offer handouts to notorious corporate polluters, and prolong Trump's polluting legacy for years." "The deal not only fails to mention, acknowledge, or address the climate crisis, but would actually contribute to it," they said.
Despite Findings Of 'Negligent' Care, ICE To Expand Troubled Calif. Detention Center,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/15/794660949/despite-findings-of-negligent-care-ice-to-expand-troubled-calif-detention-center,January 15, 2020,

 The Adelanto ICE Processing Center in Adelanto, Calif., can currently house nearly 2,000 immigrant detainees, though it is set to expand under a new contract with the federal government. When a government expert in mental health visited one of the largest immigration detention centers in the U.S. in 2017, she knew the conditions that detainees there sometimes face. A past inspection had found that staff often failed to obtain adequate mental health histories, leading to faulty diagnoses and, in some cases, treatment plans that were incorrect. Upon arrival at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in Adelanto, Calif., a similar pattern emerged. One detainee she observed had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. When she asked an officer about him, she was told that the man "floods his cell, bangs his head." She searched the man's medical chart for records from his recent stay at an inpatient psychiatric unit, but they appeared to be missing. He had been placed in what the government refers to as "segregation," a term known more commonly as solitary confinement. Inside, the expert found, he was suffering from "active auditory hallucinations." Moreover, they appeared to worsening. "I hate to be alone," he told the expert. The detainee's case is detailed in a previously confidential report on the Adelanto facility obtained by NPR. Despite the report's findings — and repeated, scathing criticism of the facility from the federal government's own internal watchdogs — ICE decided at the end of 2019 to renew and expand a contract to keep the Adelanto facility open. The report dates to late 2017, but attorneys and advocates say the problems identified in the report have persisted. ICE declined to respond to specific findings in the report. Like many other detention centers, the Adelanto facility is operated by a for-profit company — in this case, the GEO Group. The U.S. government is GEO's single biggest customer, and the company has made nearly $1 billion in federal contracts over the past 12 months, according to government data. The company's business has been threatened by a new California law that largely bans for-profit companies from operating prisons and immigration detention facilities in the state. Findings of inadequate care and treatment of detainees at the Adelanto facility and others were a driving force behind that law. But by signing the new 15-year contract before the law could take effect, GEO and the Trump administration effectively circumvented the state of California until 2034. (GEO has also sued the state in federal court, arguing that the California law is unconstitutional.) Advocates and attorneys for immigrants say the new contract — which also expands the Adelanto facility by more than 700 detention beds — demonstrates how ICE fails to hold contractors accountable for major problems in immigration detention centers. Their concerns are echoed in the report obtained by NPR from the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, an internal oversight office. Among the report's findings: The expert inspectors from the Department of Homeland Security found that, in several cases, ICE and GEO had been either unwilling or unable to fix problems despite repeated warnings over the years. The report's findings provide a window into the types of challenges presented by the Trump administration's push to detain more immigrants who are awaiting asylum hearings or deportation proceedings. Under the president's hard-line immigration policies, the number of immigrants in detention has grown to all-time highs, with private companies like GEO playing a central role in that system. While defenders say the crackdown is needed to help stem what they call a crisis on the southern border, immigration advocates say the growing reliance on detention has stretched an already troubled system to the breaking point. "These reports never see the light of day" NPR has sought records regarding the facility for more than a year and obtained this report under the Freedom of Information Act. Sources familiar with the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties say such reports almost always remain confidential. "Normally, these reports never see the light of day," says Nick Schwellenbach, a senior investigator with the nonprofit watchdog group Project On Government Oversight, or POGO. In September 2019, POGO released a version of the report after filing a public records lawsuit. But the government had more heavily redacted critical findings and recommendations. "It's kind of confounding why they withheld some of this information [from us]," says Schwellenbach. 
                Top: In a previous disclosure to the Project On Government Oversight, the government redacted significant portions of the report. Bottom: The disclosure to NPR was largely unredacted. "PBNDS" refers to Performance-Based National Detention Standards, which govern ICE facilities.

 A representative for GEO said the company would "defer to ICE" on any response to the report. Lori K. Haley, a spokesperson for ICE, also declined to comment on specific findings in the report. In an email, Haley wrote, "The safety, rights and health of detainees in ICE's care are of paramount concern." But, she noted, the agency "either did not concur or only partially concurred with roughly half their recommendations." Haley declined to say which recommendations ICE agreed with and why, or what actions the agency took in response. Lawyers, who regularly visit the facility and represent detainees there, say they have seen little evidence that ICE or GEO has followed through on the recommendations. "I don't have reason to believe that many of these reports are being taken as seriously as they should by the facility or by ICE," says Pilar Gonzalez of the nonprofit Disability Rights California, which advocates for detainees at the facility. Liz Jordan, an attorney with the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center, says the issues identified in the report have persisted. "ICE does not demand any sort of accountability from the contractors or force any changes or improvements," says Jordan, who is representing current and former Adelanto detainees in a lawsuit. "Instead, they get rewarded to keep on keeping on."

 A guard walks with a detainee in the intake area at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in 2019. A previously confidential report obtained by NPR found "negligent" medical care and other problems at the facility. "No correction was made" The Adelanto ICE Processing Center holds nearly 2,000 adult detainees, most of whom have no criminal record. Unlike prison, immigration detention is not meant as punishment. The government holds people in detention while deciding their immigration status. In November 2017, the authors of the report — three Department of Homeland Security experts in health care, corrections and mental health — traveled to Adelanto, Calif., to inspect the ICE detention facility after a series of complaints. The names of the experts are redacted in the report. All three experts found major problems, but the most serious findings in the documents obtained by NPR come from the report on health care. "Overall, the medical care at the Adelanto facility is inadequate" and does not meet federal standards, the report found, citing "incompetent clinical medical leadership." The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties had previously visited the facility in 2015 under the Obama administration and detailed "negligent" medical care at that time. But rather than seeing improvements in 2017, the experts found that medical care had gotten worse. "No correction was made," the report states, noting that the number of complaints around detainee medical care had actually increased. The medical expert cites multiple examples of poor medical care, including long delays in appointments for broken bones and a failure to provide needed antibiotics and other medications. In at least one case, a detainee's death was "likely related" to failures by the facility's medical staff. As a result, the expert recommended a drastic measure: "At-risk detainees must be immediately removed from the facility (transferred to another facility with a well-functioning medical program)." Given the problems at the facility, the expert defined "at-risk" as any detainee with a chronic medical problem like diabetes, as well as any detainee over 55 years old. Attorneys for detainees told NPR that there's no indication that ICE or GEO actually followed this recommendation. ICE declined to say whether it made changes to its medical staff in the wake of the report or transferred detainees. Allegations of "verbal harassment" and "retaliation" The allegations against the Adelanto facility went beyond medical care. "Detainees suffer retaliation, verbal harassment and [are] treated with disrespect," the report found. Leadership "must hold facility staff accountable for substantiated abusive and disrespectful treatment of the detainees," the report went on, noting that this problem had not been addressed after previous inspections. In another instance, detainees alleged even harsher measures. In June 2017, a group of asylum-seekers from Central America went on hunger strike to protest conditions at the facility. When the group locked arms and refused to move, staff used pepper spray and physically removed them. The corrections expert found that the use of pepper spray was "appropriate given the circumstances." But the expert saw a significant problem with the staff's subsequent actions. Cold water is recommended to safely decontaminate pepper spray. But, the corrections expert found, "The facility does not have any access to cold water. The facility only provides a mix of cold and hot water through a shower head." The expert warned that "warm water will exacerbate the burning effect of the OC pepper spray." When the group of hunger strikers was placed in showers, they described "writhing" in pain as the water reactivated the spray. One detainee, Marvin Josue Grande Rodriguez, said that he fainted in the shower, because "the gas and the heat of the water ... It was far too much for me." The report says the use of a hot shower was a "significant issue" and concluded that the facility "must provide access to a cold-water shower" in the future.

 A detainee waits to be processed at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center. In response to a lawsuit filed by the group of hunger strikers, lawyers for GEO said that water "does reactivate the tingling sensation" from pepper spray but that it was "necessary to remove the spray" and was not intended to cause pain. Because ICE and GEO declined to answer specific questions, it's unclear if they followed the recommendation on cold-water showers. Attorneys for detainees told NPR that they were unsure whether any changes had been made. But it is clear that the facility staff continue to use pepper spray. ICE statistics show that pepper spray has been used more than 25 times since the 2017 inspection. An "inhumane" use of solitary confinement Additionally, the government's experts found that the Adelanto facility was failing to meet federal standards for solitary confinement — known in ICE's bureaucratic language as "segregation." Overall, the report found that GEO Group staff had "no current strategy" when it came to long-term use of solitary confinement and that people were suffering as a result. In one case, inspectors found, a detainee was held in a "Special Management Unit," or SMU, for 426 days. "No detainee should be held in the SMU for this amount of time," the report states. "Isolation alone can create physical safety concerns and can result in mental decompensation." The expert inspectors were especially critical of the use of solitary confinement for immigrants with serious mental disorders. They found that about a third of the detainees held in solitary had a "serious mental illness." Over the course of multiple stays, one detainee logged 904 days — or nearly 2 1/2 years — in solitary confinement, which the report calls "shockingly high." The experts found that some detainees with serious mental illness were put in solitary confinement simply because it was the only available space where they could be closely watched. The report called that practice "inhumane." "If strategies are not developed," the report warned, "the mental health and other long-term detainee cases will continue to decompensate, and the population of the SMU will continue to grow." In response to NPR, an ICE spokesperson wrote that the agency "is compliant" with agency standards on the use of solitary confinement, citing a directive from 2013. But again, critics of ICE say that is not true. "You have these experts ... essentially screaming from the rooftops, 'You need to fix this problem!' " says Schwellenbach of POGO, which has also investigated the use of solitary confinement in ICE detention. "There's solutions that they're actually putting forward, but they're being ignored." Ongoing oversight of immigration detention  The state of California has repeatedly clashed with the Trump administration over immigration policy. The office of California Sen. Kamala Harris, a former Democratic presidential candidate and former state attorney general, reviewed the documents obtained by NPR. "It is unconscionable to subject detained persons to inhumane conditions," Harris' office said in a statement, "including issues arising from insufficient medical care as well as prolonged isolation and detention at immigrant detention facilities." Criticism of conditions at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center by Harris and others was one factor that led to the recent California law, largely banning the use of private contractors in prisons and immigration detention centers. "State laws aimed at obstructing federal law enforcement are inappropriate and harmful," ICE's Haley wrote to NPR. "Policy makers who strive to make it more difficult to remove dangerous criminal aliens and aim to stop the cooperation of local officials and business partners, harm the very communities whose welfare they have sworn to protect." In their lawsuit against the state, GEO argues that the law is a "transparent attempt by the State to shut down the Federal Government's detention efforts within California's borders" and "a direct assault on the supremacy of federal law." California state legislator Rob Bonta, who championed the law, tweeted that the lawsuit was, "Exactly what you'd expect fr[om] a collapsing industry in its final death throes."

 President Trump and Vice Premier Liu He, China's top trade negotiator, sign a "Phase 1" trade agreement between the U.S. and China at the White House on Wednesday. Updated at 2:07 p.m. ET  A year and a half after launching his trade war against China, President Trump signed a partial truce on Wednesday.  "We mark more than just an agreement. We mark a sea change in international trade," Trump said during a White House signing ceremony. "At long last, Americans have a government that puts them first." The president agreed to relax some of the tariffs he imposed on Chinese imports. In exchange, Beijing has agreed to buy more American products and make other changes. "This is a big win for the president," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News, while conceding the "Phase 1" agreement does not achieve all of the reforms the administration initially sought. "It's not everything," he acknowledged. "There will be a 'Phase 2.' But this is the first time we've had a comprehensive agreement with China." As part of that deal, China has promised to provide more protection for American companies' intellectual property and to stop requiring U.S. companies to share their technology as a cost of doing business in China. Beijing has a history of backsliding on such pledges. But the administration expressed confidence that the terms of this deal are enforceable.  "This agreement will work if China wants it to work," said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. "They expect and we expect it to be enforced to the letter."  The administration agreed not to impose tariffs last month on some $160 billion in Chinese imports — including popular consumer items such as cellphones and laptops — as part of the Phase 1 agreement. It also reduced the tariff rate on another $112 billion worth of goods from 15% to 7.5%. But steep 25% tariffs remain in place on much of what the U.S. buys from China, including components that American factories use to assemble finished products. While Trump insists that China is paying those tariffs, numerous studies have found the costs are largely borne by American importers. "This continues to be a drag on the manufacturing sector, which really has not been doing well in the last couple of quarters," said Syracuse University economist Mary Lovely. Farmers also took a hit during the trade war, as China cut back sharply on its purchases of U.S. agricultural products. "It's been a long haul, and the lack of certainty is probably the most challenging portion of this," said Kristin Duncanson, who raises soybeans, corn and hogs in south central Minnesota. "We can weather the weather. We know how to do that. It's weathering the politics that's the tough part." Duncanson estimates her soybean crop lost 30% to 40% of its value during the trade war, thanks to low prices and the lack of Chinese demand. That loss was only partially offset by federal aid for affected farmers. Duncanson is hoping for a rebound once the trade agreement is signed. "We're optimistic that signing the agreement will reopen some opportunities, especially for the Upper Midwest," she said. "But I'm also a realist enough to know until those beans are actually shipped to customers that we can't count our chickens before they're hatched." The administration says China has pledged to boost its purchases of U.S. goods and services over the next two years by $200 billion over 2017 levels. That would represent an increase of more than 50%.  That includes $32 billion in additional agricultural purchases, $78 billion in manufactured goods, $52 billion in energy products, and $38 billion in additional U.S. services.  "We're delighted that the Chinese consumers will now enjoy the greater access to the best products on earth: those made, grown and raised right here in the USA," Trump said.  Lovely said it's possible for China to increase its purchases by $200 billion, but warned it could have a disruptive effect on global trade flows. "This should be giving our other trade partners some serious anxiety because one way [for China] to achieve those targets is simply to stop buying from other countries and shift purchases to the U.S.," she said. China's Vice Premier Liu He joined  Trump at the White House for the signing ceremony.   While the agreement leaves major economic disputes between the two countries unresolved, Lovely said the 18-month trade war has allowed both sides to send a message. "The U.S. is going to use whatever muscle it can to get what it wants," she said. "On the other hand, it's also shown the United States that China's going to be very hard to bully." 
Study: Tinder, Grindr And Other Apps Share Sensitive Personal Data With Advertisers,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/14/796427696/study-grindr-tindr-and-other-apps-share-sensitive-personal-data-with-advertisers,January 14, 2020,

 Dating apps, including Tinder, give sensitive information about users to marketing companies, according to a Norwegian study released Tuesday. A group of civil rights and consumer groups is urging federal and state regulators to examine a number of mobile apps, including popular dating apps Grindr, Tinder and OKCupid for allegedly sharing personal information with advertising companies. The push by the privacy rights coalition follows a report published on Tuesday by the Norwegian Consumer Council that found 10 apps collect sensitive information including a user's exact location, sexual orientation, religious and political beliefs, drug use and other information and then transmit the personal data to at least 135 different third-party companies.  The data harvesting, according to the Norwegian government agency, appears to violate the European Union's rules intended to protect people's online data, known as the General Data Protection Regulation.  In the U.S., consumer groups are equally alarmed. The group urging regulators to act on the Norwegian study, led by government watchdog group Public Citizen, says Congress should use the findings as a roadmap to pass a new law patterned after Europe's tough data privacy rules that took effect in 2018.  "These apps and online services spy on people, collect vast amounts of personal data and share it with third parties without people's knowledge. Industry calls it adtech. We call it surveillance," said Burcu Kilic, a lawyer who leads the digital rights program at Public Citizen. "We need to regulate it now, before it's too late."  The Norwegian study, which looks only at apps on Android phones, traces the journey a user's personal information takes before it arrives at marketing companies.  For example, Grindr's app includes Twitter-owned advertising software, which collects and processes personal information and unique identifiers such as a phone's ID and IP address, allowing advertising companies to track consumers across devices. This Twitter-owned go-between for personal data is controlled by a firm called MoPub.  "Grindr only lists Twitter's MoPub as an advertising partner, and encourages users to read the privacy policies of MoPub's own partners to understand how data is used. MoPub lists more than 160 partners, which clearly makes it impossible for users to give an informed consent to how each of these partners may use personal data," the report states.  This is not the first time Grindr has become embroiled in controversy over data sharing. In 2018, the dating app announced it would stop sharing users' HIV status with companies following a report in BuzzFeed exposing the practice, leading AIDS advocates to raise questions about health, safety and personal privacy.  The latest data violations unearthed by the Norwegian researchers come the same month California enacted the strongest data privacy law in the U.S. Under the law, known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, consumers can opt out of the sale of their personal information. If tech companies do not comply, the law permits the user to sue.   In its letter sent Tuesday to the California attorney general, the ACLU of California argues that the practice described in the Norwegian report may violate the state's new data privacy law, in addition to constituting possible unfair and deceptive practices, which is unlawful in California.  A Twitter spokesperson said in a statement that the company has suspended advertising software used by Grindr highlighted in the report as the company reviews the study's findings.  "We are currently investigating this issue to understand the sufficiency of Grindr's consent mechanism. In the meantime, we have disabled Grindr's MoPub account," a Twitter spokesperson told NPR.  The study found the dating app OKCupid shared details about a user's sexuality, drug use, political views and more to an analytics company called Braze.  The Match Group, the company that owns OKCupid and Tinder, said in a statement that privacy was at the core of its business, saying it only shares information to third parties that comply with applicable laws.  "All Match Group products obtain from these vendors strict contractual commitments that ensure confidentiality, security of users' personal information and strictly prohibit commercialization of this data," a company spokesman said.  Many app users, the study noted, never try to read or understand the privacy policies before using an app. But even if the policies are studied, the Norwegian researchers say the legalese-filled documents sometimes do not provide a complete picture of what is happening with a person's personal information.   "If one actually attempts to read the privacy policy of any given app, the third parties who may receive personal data are often not mentioned by name. If the third parties are actually listed, the consumer then has to read the privacy policies of these third parties to understand how they may use the data," the study says.  "In other words, it is practically impossible for the consumer to have even a basic overview of what and where their personal data might be transmitted, or how it is used, even from only a single app."

 Foxconn's substation under construction in Mount Pleasant, Wis., on Dec. 15, 2019. State officials hope the company will help turn the region into the next Silicon Valley. During a ceremony at the White House in July 2017, a beaming President Trump announced Foxconn was coming to Wisconsin. The world's largest contract manufacturer of consumer electronics wanted to be in America, Trump said. "Investing many, many billions of dollars, right here in America, creating thousands of jobs," Trump said. "And I mean, American jobs, that's what we want." To land the company, Wisconsin's then-governor, Republican Scott Walker, signed one of the largest tax incentive deals ever made between a state and a private company. Foxconn was offered more than $3 billion in exchange for 13,000 jobs. Local governments sweetened the deal with another nearly $1 billion in tax incentives. The last two years have been a largely bumpy ride in Wisconsin. First, Foxconn reduced the size of the LCD display panels it said it would build in the state. And in 2018, the company didn't meet the job threshold to qualify for state money. Now, construction is underway in Racine County, Wis. The nearly 1 million square foot advanced manufacturing factory — significantly less than the originally promised 22 million square foot manufacturing plant — is now enclosed and may be ready to go this year. Construction crews are also working on two more buildings. And Foxconn says workers are in another facility completed last year. Kim Mahoney, who co-owns the last home next to the project, says it's still not what Foxconn pledged.  "They're not creating the jobs they promised. ... And that's what the draw was, to bring those manufacturing jobs back to southeastern Wisconsin, and that's not what's happening, it doesn't appear," Mahoney says. Emails published by the The Verge show that for months, Wisconsin's now-Democratic Gov. Tony Evers had been encouraging Foxconn to revise its state contract to better reflect what appears to be a downsized manufacturing operation. Foxconn has denied repeated requests for interviews. But in a written statement the company said, "Foxconn will make business and hiring decisions based on timing that positions the company and future generations for long-term success."  Unfulfilled promises Seven months after Foxconn announced it would build its massive manufacturing plant in southeastern Wisconsin, Scott Walker began making more promises. "We see the ever-growing footprint of Wisconn Valley in this state, and we see what we like to call, the 'Foxconn bonus,' " Walker said. Over the next several months that Foxconn bonus included establishing "innovation centers" in Milwaukee, Green Bay, Eau Claire, Racine and Madison. Foxconn bought buildings in the cities' downtowns, promising to employ hundreds of workers at each site. The company said it would recruit from nearby colleges.  Two years later, nothing has opened. And none of the 1,200 jobs have been filled. The innovation centers themselves were vaguely explained as a place to foster entrepreneurship. Matt Jewell, an engineering professor at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, said he hoped his students could work at Foxconn. But he's unclear what the company is doing. "As a general term, innovation center doesn't say anything specific to us, so we were from the start trying to understand what they meant by that," Jewell said. Milwaukee Alderman Robert Bauman, who represents the city's downtown, said  the entire project was designed to ensure the reelection of Walker in 2018. He lost that year to Evers, a Democrat.     "No question about it," Bauman said. "And to a lesser degree to play to a political storyline that Trump was trying to peddle." In an email, Foxconn said the timing of the innovation centers will be based on timing that "positions the company and its Wisconsin employees for competitive success in support of the Wisconn Valley Science and Technology Park." The email stated that permits have been issued for innovation centers in Green Bay and Racine; however, those permits show that work being done is less than one-fifth the size originally promised. Tax incentives Critics of the more than $3 billion tax incentive deal argue it's too risky for tax payers. Tim Bartik, a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, has been studying business incentives for more than 20 years.  His research shows that a new factory doesn't always translate to a job for an unemployed person living nearby. 
                Jim and Kim Mahoney can see Foxconn construction from their home in Mount Pleasant, Wis. State and local officials offered nearly $4 billion in incentives to lure the company to Wisconsin. Kim says they haven't created the promised jobs.

 Jim and Kim Mahoney can see Foxconn construction from their home in Mount Pleasant, Wis. State and local officials offered nearly $4 billion in incentives to lure the company to Wisconsin. Kim says they haven't created the promised jobs. "It's not clear to me that the voters understand that incentives have a cost and that they're not a free lunch," Bartik said. "I think people get lost in the details of the arguments over the benefits and costs of incentives." But Ellen Harpel, who runs a consulting company working with governments as they negotiate deals, disagrees. While she concedes that some big incentive deals have gone bad, she insists the model is still worth pursuing.    Harpel said deals need to include safeguards for states and include ways to claw back money if businesses don't do what they said they would. Supporters of the Foxconn deal say those protections are in place.  "A well-designed and well-managed incentive program can absolutely help achieve a community's economic development goals," Harpel said. Political sticking point The Foxconn project continues to divide the state politically. Democratic Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz said politics collided with business. "Foxconn has admitted that it doesn't make any sense from a financial standpoint to do any manufacturing in the U.S., much less Wisconsin," Gordon said. But Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said Foxconn should be left alone to conduct its business. "I have John Deere in my district. I don't check in with them on a regular basis to say, 'Jeez, what are you guys doing at this juncture?' you know?" Fitzgerald said. "It's the private sector. They need to have the flexibility to be competitive and move at the speed of business." Even though Walker is no longer governor, Trump remains one of Foxconn's biggest supporters. He came for the groundbreaking of the Foxconn plant nearly three years ago, and he'll be there again Tuesday to give another campaign speech. This story was a joint collaboration with WPR and WUWM.

 BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink, seen here in Paris in July, wrote in his annual letter to CEOs that climate change will soon cause "a significant reallocation of capital." BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, says that it will now make climate change central to its investment considerations. And not just for environmental reasons — but because it believes that climate change is reshaping the world's financial system. That was the message in BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink's annual letter to CEOs published on Tuesday.  "The evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance," he wrote, explaining that climate change is the top concern that investors raise with BlackRock. "In the near future — and sooner than most anticipate — there will be a significant reallocation of capital." BlackRock manages approximately $7 trillion on behalf of investors. Its shift could signify a watershed moment for corporate action on climate, particularly among U.S. firms. BlackRock says it will require additional reporting from the companies it invests in, including disclosure of climate-related risks and plans for operating under the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. Fink raised a number of financial risks presented by climate change:  "Will cities, for example, be able to afford their infrastructure needs as climate risk reshapes the market for municipal bonds? What will happen to the 30-year mortgage — a key building block of finance — if lenders can't estimate the impact of climate risk over such a long timeline, and if there is no viable market for flood or fire insurance in impacted areas? What happens to inflation, and in turn interest rates, if the cost of food climbs from drought and flooding? How can we model economic growth if emerging markets see their productivity decline due to extreme heat and other climate impacts?" Fink said BlackRock will remove companies that generate more than 25% of their revenues from coal production from its actively managed portfolios. But only about a quarter of BlackRock's assets are actively managed, according to Reuters. The majority of BlackRock's assets are in passively managed index funds, and thus wouldn't be subject to the policy.  Nonetheless, BlackRock's move can provide companies that want to move on climate a weighty business justification for doing so: If they don't, they risk being dropped from the investment giant's funds. Fink also warned that BlackRock won't hesitate to use its status as a major shareholder to pressure companies accordingly: "[W]e will be increasingly disposed to vote against management and board directors when companies are not making sufficient progress on sustainability-related disclosures and the business practices and plans underlying them." This isn't the first time Fink has caused a stir with his CEO letter. Two years ago, his letter called on CEOs to focus less on short-term profits and more on long-term growth and making a positive contribution to society. BlackRock has been under criticism from activists to put pressure on fossil fuel companies or stop investing in them.  A group called The Sunrise Project was among the organizers of a campaign called BlackRock's Big Problem, which pointed out that BlackRock is a huge investor in coal plants, coal reserves, and oil and gas companies. It also identified Fink as potentially sympathetic to their cause: "He's a Democrat, a philanthropist, and sits on the board of a major conservation organization." (In a 2010 interview with Vanity Fair, Fink called himself a "lifelong Democrat.") But Fink says the move is all about business. "We are fiduciaries," he told The New York Times. "Politics isn't part of this."  The Sunrise Project was among the conservation organizations cheering Fink's letter on Tuesday — and hoping that it will spur other asset managers to do the same. "BlackRock's new initiatives match the size of the crisis we're seeing in 2020 and are the direct result of an outpouring of pressure from the global climate movement," Sunrise Project senior strategist Diana Best said in a statement. "BlackRock beginning its shift of capital out of fossil fuels, including today's divestment of coal in its actively managed funds, is a fantastic start and instantly raises the bar for competitors such as Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors."

A few of these sellers are offering counterfeit goods and in cases of legal action, can be difficult to track down to face consequences.  This can be particularly dangerous for children's products. Car seats, swaddling blankets, and toys sold by counterfeiters do not always pass safety regulations and can put your child in harm's way. They also negatively impact the legitimate brands they're ripping off.  So, how is Amazon responding to this problem, and is the law changing to hold it more liable?

FDA Approves Drugs Faster Than Ever But Relies On Weaker Evidence, Researchers Find,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/01/14/796227083/fda-approves-drugs-faster-than-ever-but-relies-on-weaker-evidence-researchers-fi,January 14, 2020,

 The Food And Drug Administration reviews new drugs for approval much faster than it used to, but changes in the agency's standards have drawn questions. The Food and Drug Administration has gotten faster at approving new prescription drugs over the past four decades, but the evidence it relies on in making those decisions is getting weaker, according to new research published Tuesday. As a result, there are more cures and treatments on the market but less proof that they are safe and effective. "There has been a gradual erosion of the evidence that's required for FDA approval," says lead study author Jonathan Darrow, a lawyer with Harvard Medical School's Program on Regulation, Therapeutics and Law. As a result, patients and physicians "should not expect that new drugs will be dramatically better than older ones." Almost half of recent new drug approvals were based on only one pivotal clinical trial instead of the two or more that used to be the norm, according to the study published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association. And the reliance on surrogate measures — stand-ins for presumed patient benefits — has increased. In the case of cancer drugs, a surrogate measure could be shrinkage of tumors instead of improvements in survival after treatment. Darrow and his colleagues analyzed FDA drug approvals, changes in laws and regulations and the rise in industry funding of the agency's reviews from 1983 through 2018.  The researchers found that the average number of new drug approvals per year increased from 34 in the 1990s to 41 in the 2010s, after a dip to 25 a year in the 2000s.  New drugs are getting through the FDA process faster. In 2018, the median review time for standard drug applications was 10.1 months compared with 2.8 years for standard and priority applications for the period from 1986 and 1992. Faster approval was the goal of many legislative and regulatory changes starting in the 1980s. For instance, in 1983, Congress passed the Orphan Drug Act to encourage drugmakers toward developing rare disease treatments that otherwise might not be profitable. The FDA allowed approval for these drugs based on smaller trials with more flexible evidence standards, and it offered more time on the market for the medicines without generic competition. Drugmakers also began paying the FDA fees to fund the review process after AIDS activists protested the agency's sluggishness in the 1980s.  The FDA collected $29 million in fees in 1993, the year after Congress passed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act for the first time. The fees rose to $908 million in 2018. That year, industry fees amounted to about 80% of the money spent on FDA employee salaries for drug reviews, according to the study. "There is some concern about the incentives that this is created within the FDA," Darrow says. "And whether it has created a culture in the FDA where the primary client is no longer viewed as the patient, but as the industry." Former FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Dr. Joshua Sharfstein says the FDA has succeeded in approving more drugs, but he also says that more changes are needed to make sure the medicines are worthwhile for patients.  "Some of them are really great, and some of them [are] not so great," says Sharfstein, now a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "And a lot of them are very expensive." In an accompanying editorial in JAMA, Sharfstein offers several suggestions for change, including a reevaluation of the FDA's expedited approval programs to see which ones are working and which ones are mainly driving up health care costs. "We've kind of reached a point where it makes sense to pause and see whether we can do things better," Sharfstein says. "And I think we can."

 The Nobel Prize-winning economist Angus Deaton was recently one of the speakers at a panel, "Beyond GDP." Editor's note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here. Earlier this month, a group of economists gathered at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association to discuss the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, which for over 75 years, has been tracking GDP, or Gross Domestic Product. GDP is the total monetary value of all the goods and services produced by a country within a given period of time. Politicians, journalists, and many others regularly cite GDP as the ultimate measure of national prosperity. The economists, who were speaking at a panel called "Beyond GDP," made clear they think that's a huge mistake. GDP misses a lot. It doesn't, for instance, count the cooking, cleaning, and childrearing done in households. It doesn't count the value of people's health or a clean environment. It doesn't pay attention to the distribution of income or wealth. It doesn't pay attention to quality of life. One of the panelists was the Nobel Prize-winning Princeton economist Angus Deaton, who has spent the last few years researching the rising numbers of "deaths of despair," which is when struggling people die from self-inflicted causes, like suicide and drug overdoses. "Life expectancy has fallen for three years in a row," Deaton said. "One of the major drivers of that is the opioid epidemic, which has so far killed over 200,000 Americans." Pharmaceutical companies, he said, have made billions off this epidemic. "We've got a system that's really killing people—and we're counting that money as part of GDP. That's gotta be crazy." The economist J. Steven Landefeld, who headed the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) for 20 years, believes that the BEA needs to do a better job tracking and communicating statistics beyond GDP. "What's wrong with GDP is it excludes a lot of things that are important to people," he says. The problem, Landefeld says, is that much of the stuff it's missing, like the value of household work or a clean environment, is really hard to effectively measure. These sectors don't have market transactions creating a paper trail of numbers that the government can easily track. They're "big and uncertain and you don't want to chuck them into GDP," he says, because it would make GDP data less accurate, objective, and useful. They're also hard to combine into one statistic. The BEA is listening. And it will start publishing new "satellite accounts" that will provide alternative measures of prosperity. These, Landefeld stresses, won't replace GDP. They'll sit alongside it and be free for the public to use as they wish. The agency, he says, will begin this year by doing a better job of showcasing data on economic well-being already at its disposal. Its first new satellite account will feature estimates on the distribution of personal income. After this year, he says, the agency hopes to develop satellite accounts that supplement GDP on a number of other dimensions, including the effects of global trade and the skills and education of American workers. Over the past couple decades, there's been a movement to displace GDP totally with a measure of societal happiness. Landefeld thinks that would be a mistake. Happiness, he says, is the product of a whole range of factors that go well beyond the economy, and we shouldn't expect wonky agencies like BEA to be able to effectively track all of them and combine them into a single, coherent statistic. This isn't the first time the GDP has come under attack. After he announced his candidacy for president in 1968, Robert F. Kennedy railed against GDP in one of his first speeches. It "counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage," Kennedy said. It counts jails, napalm, nuclear warheads, and "the loss of natural wonder in chaotic sprawl." Yet, he said, it did not pay attention to "the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play... It measures everything in short—except that which makes life worthwhile." Did you enjoy this newsletter? Well, it looks even better in your inbox! You can sign up here.

 The Navajo Generating Station shut down in November 2019. The West's largest coal-fired power plant provided $12 million in yearly royalties to the Hopi Tribe. For decades, coal has been at the center of Hopi life, literally. In the middle of each home is a coal-burning stove that keeps families warm through the winter. "A lot of people relied on the coal to heat their homes and ceremonial chambers, the kivas," says Leigh Wayne Lomayestewa, who works in the tribe's cultural preservation office. "And now we're only relying on the cedar wood." But he says cedar doesn't burn as long as coal. "Usually at nighttime, you can put in about two or three times a night," Lomayestewa says. When the West's largest coal-fired power plant shut down late last year in northern Arizona, it marked the end of an era. It took with it hundreds of jobs and $12 million in yearly royalties paid to the Hopi Tribe. That's 80% of the tribe's annual budget. Now, Hopi leaders are trying to figure out how to replace this economic lifeline.  Two years ago, the plant's operators, a group of utilities, voted to shut it down. Natural gas had become cheaper than complying with the coal plant's air quality regulations. Hopi Vice Chairman Clark Tenakhongva says that's left both Navajo and Hopi Tribes scrambling to find new sources of revenue. "So with really nothing right now over the horizon with what revenues we have," Tenakhongva says, "what investments we have over the last 40 to 50 years at the level we're operating, we could survive another six to seven years on what we have."  That doesn't give them much time to come up with a new way of making money. Tenakhongva says the tribe has many options. It's just a matter of agreeing on one.  Wide range of alternatives  "We've got property in Winslow," Tenakhongva says. "We've got the I-40 corridor that has mass amounts of land that could be developed. The money's not going to come there the first two years but by 8 to 10 years we'll have something that we can say, 'yeah, this is the Hopi casino. Yeah, this is the Hopi ranches serving nothing but prime Hopi beef.'" There's also tourism. Guide Meredith Qotswisiwma drives up the switchbacks to the historic Walpi Village. She says tourism has been a challenge because of the tribe's location. They're isolated, completely surrounded by the Navajo Nation. "We're in a remote area so money-wise it's hard for us to go out and even advertise our tourism program," Qotswisiwma says. "So it's really hard." The Hopi are working with the Navajo to build a road that would loop them into popular destinations like Monument Valley and Canyon de Chelly for tour companies coming from Las Vegas. The tribe is even open to unusual ideas like the one pitched by engineer T.J. Agardy who came to a recent tribal council meeting. He's proposing technology used in Germany and Japan to harvest coalbed methane and turn it into natural gas.  "When we're done, that equipment stays here," Agardy told the tribal council. "You now have the ability to take and power yourselves up for the next 300 years." He offered that long-term energy production solution and revenue stream as an alternative to the more short-term thinking of coal.  "If you look at what happened before," said Agardy, "you're left with an empty hole and a lot of empty promises." The Hopi are cautious about any of these possibilities because they've been burned before by the federal government, other outside investors and even by other tribes.  Vice-Chairman Tenakhongva knows many people have left the reservation and many more will follow without better economic opportunities. But Tenakhongva says he's not going anywhere. He's got two years left of his term. And he plans to find a solution to the tribe's economic crisis before his time is up. More than ever, Tenakhongva is trying to hold onto what he calls his Hopi optimism. "The sun will come up tomorrow," Tenakhongva says. "We will continue to live but maybe not at the level of the comforts of what we have had."
Emotional Currency: How Money Shapes Human Relationships,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/10/795246685/emotional-currency-how-money-shapes-human-relationships,January 13, 2020, There's a story you may have heard before about what the world look like before money was invented. It's a story built on the idea of barter.  "It goes something like this: in the beginning, before there was money, if I had something that you needed, I would approach you with that thing and see if you had anything that I needed," says anthropologist Bill Maurer. "The problem is that when we look around the world and in the historical and archaeological record for instances of this kind of direct barter, unfortunately we don't find it." This week on Hidden Brain, we challenge established ideas about the origins of currency, and highlight the connection between money and relationships.  "Society is a thing of ongoing continuous relationships. The settling and unsettling of debts, on and on and on and on and on."

China To Test Digital Currency. Could It End Up Challenging The Dollar Globally?,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/13/795988512/china-to-test-digital-currency-could-it-end-up-challenging-the-dollar-globally,January 13, 2020,

 Alipay and WeChat QR codes for online payment are displayed at a vegetable stall in Nantong in China's eastern Jiangsu province. Now China's central bank is preparing to test a digital currency. China is light-years ahead of the United States in doing away with old-fashioned paper money. Now China's central bank is preparing to test a digital currency. And some observers say it could mark the beginning of a new economic arms race, challenging the supremacy of the U.S. dollar. Already, hundreds of millions of consumers in China have grown used to paying for purchases without cash, using popular smartphone apps such as WeChat and Alipay. "Everything is immensely convenient" in China, said Martin Chorzempa, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "You pretty much only need these two apps to do just about anything. You walk into a restaurant, scan a code and order your food. You don't have to wait for a waiter. All the payments are automatic. It's quite extraordinary." Chinese tech companies — counterparts to Amazon and Facebook — took the lead in developing this system. They leapfrogged ahead of their U.S. competitors out of necessity, because China didn't start out with a well-established payment system built on credit cards. "When Amazon started, it wasn't a major challenge to figure out, 'Well, how are people going to pay for the books that they order?' " said Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management. "With China, a lot of people didn't have credit cards, so they had to come up with ways to facilitate their customers doing this." Now that tech companies have paved the way, China's central bank wants a piece of this digital action. The bank has been working on a digital currency for the last six years, but the effort shifted into overdrive last summer after Facebook unveiled plans for its own electronic form of money, called Libra. "They are definitely one of the most advanced central banks in the world in thinking about and moving forward on this issue," Chorzempa said. China's central bank worried that if nearly 2.5 billion Facebook users suddenly had their own electronic currency, China's digital money could be left in the dust. The bank raced to complete design work and is now reportedly preparing for the first pilot tests of its digital currency. The digital yuan is expected to function more like its paper cousin than a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin. Its value is tied to the regular yuan, so it's expected to be relatively stable. And the central bank will be able to monitor every transaction, so it won't have Bitcoin's anonymity. "Actually, the term that the central bank officials in China have used is 'controllable anonymity,' which is one of the most Orwellian statements one could think about," Chorzempa said. If China stepped on the gas following Facebook's announcement, regulators in the U.S. hit the brakes. "Libra raises a lot of serious concerns, and those include around privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers last July. "Those are going to need to be thoroughly and publicly assessed and evaluated before this proceeds." Libra has also faced skepticism from other industrialized countries. Some of Facebook's original partners in the venture, including Visa and Mastercard, have backed out. But Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is undaunted, casting the currency race as an international competition. "China is moving quickly to launch a similar idea in the coming months," Zuckerberg told a House committee in October. "If America doesn't innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed." Princeton University historian Harold James, who co-authored a paper on digital currency, says Zuckerberg has a point. "We're right at the edge of a kind of gigantic technical change," James said. He says China's new digital currency could come to rival the dollar as an international means of payment. Other observers are more skeptical. "We're still in the really early stages of this," said Erik Nelson of Wells Fargo Securities. "If China really wants to establish itself as the main reserve currency and try and dethrone the dollar, it's going to have to take a lot more steps on the governance front, on opening up its markets to foreign investors. I don't think digitization is going to be the thing that does it." Digital currencies could make financial transactions cheaper, easier and more efficient. To the extent they catch on, though, they could also trigger an upheaval in the global financial system — regardless of whether they're sponsored by an American tech giant or the Chinese central bank.
How Trade Wars Fill The Swamp,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/13/796011798/how-trade-wars-fill-the-swamp,January 13, 2020, The U.S. trade wars with China and other countries have now been running for nearly two years, and have cost businesses and consumers billions of dollars.  Some companies have fought a kind of shadow war by hiring lobbyists to try and secure tariff exclusions for them. Lobbyists get these exclusions in part by using their connections with the Trump administration, and in many cases they're successful. That's good news for the companies that can afford lobbyists, but it puts smaller businesses, who can't afford that kind of firepower, at a big disadvantage.  In new investigative report, Lydia DePillis of ProPublica found that the competition to be excluded from the trade war has led to some perverse economic consequences.

 Boeing 737 Max planes are parked on the tarmac after the jets were grounded because of two crashes. Updated at 11 a.m. ET As he moves into the chief executive's suite in Boeing's 36-story world headquarters building in downtown Chicago today, David Calhoun will find he has monumental tasks ahead of him. The aerospace giant is still reeling from the fallout of two 737 Max jetliner crashes — in Indonesia in October 2018 and in Ethiopia last March — that killed a total of 346 people. Documents released by Boeing late last week reveal that during the years the 737 Max was under development, key company employees appear to have hidden safety problems and deceived regulators and customers, while also sometimes mocking them, along with some of Boeing's suppliers and even fellow employees. "I'm just shaking my head and rolling my eyes," says Scott Hamilton, an aviation industry consultant for the Leeham Company, who has been closely watching Boeing since the 1970s. He says he can understand expressing frustrations in the workplace, "but in this case, this goes beyond frustrations. This is disdain, this is contempt for the regulators, for some of their customers and even for some of their co-workers." "This is another black eye for Boeing," Hamilton adds. Even though it may not hurt the company's efforts to get the troubled 737 Max recertified by regulators around the world, he says, "It's going to affect the ability to restore confidence in the traveling public." The more than 100 pages of emails and internal instant messages show a pattern of deceit as Boeing employees downplay safety problems with the 737 Max. In one of the most shocking messages, one worker tells another, "This plane was designed by clowns who are in turn supervised by monkeys." Another unnamed employee, while complaining about safety flaws, mentions that the company once admired for high safety standards has changed and "created a culture of 'good enough' and that is an incredibly low bar." In another exchange, one employee asks a colleague, "Would you put your family on a Max simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn't." The colleague responds, "No." The documents also detail schemes to hide information about a new automated flight control system on the Max that has been pinpointed as a primary cause of the two deadly crashes, as well as efforts to mislead regulators so they didn't require costly pilot training in a simulator, something that some experts say might have been able to prevent the plane crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. "It's horrifying," says Nadia Milleron, the mother of Samya Stumo, who was 24 when she was killed in the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 310 on March 10. "I feel like I'm living a nightmare; I keep wanting to wake up." "These revelations sicken me," adds Michael Stumo, Samya's father. "The culture of Boeing has eroded horribly," he added. "My daughter is dead as a result." The documents released by Boeing dropped late Thursday on the FAA and congressional committees investigating the 737 Max crisis. They paint a picture of a corporate culture fixated on cutting costs, as well as boosting profits and shareholder value, at the expense of engineering excellence and safety. "It's terrible. The company has to change completely in order to actually produce safe aircraft," Milleron says. Milleron and some others say they don't have much faith in the new CEO Calhoun, a private equity executive and onetime head of GE's aircraft engine unit, who has served on Boeing's board of directors for more than a decade. "I would point out that David Calhoun has been on the board since 2009 and has set and endorsed the policies of shareholder value and cost," Hamilton says. "And so I would say he's actually part of the problem." Milleron puts it more bluntly to those expecting Calhoun to bring an outsider's perspective and shake things up: "He's not new to the company. He is partially responsible for my daughter's death." Boeing has made one significant change, reversing its long-held position that pilots don't need training on a simulator to fly a 737 Max even after its flaws are fixed. The company is now recommending simulator training for all 737 Max pilots before the plane is certified to return to passenger service. Pilots and travelers' advocates applaud the reversal in Boeing's position, but some say they are disturbed to discover in the emails and other messages released last week the great lengths Boeing went to in order to fight against such recommendations. One of the airlines that the documents show had been pushing for Boeing to provide their pilots with more costly and time-consuming simulator training was Indonesia's Lion Air. On Oct. 29, 2018, Lion Air Flight 610 was the first Boeing 737 Max to crash, killing all 189 people on board. "Boeing worked very hard to dissuade them, pressure them, some might say, bully them by using examples of other airlines around the world and regulators around the world that said the simulator time wasn't necessary," says Sean Broderick, senior air transport and safety editor at Aviation Week, adding that "Boeing, in that case, didn't take its customers' best interest into consideration. It took its own best interests into consideration." Rebuilding relationships with airlines, with pilots and with aviation regulators is among the top challenges Calhoun faces, as is restoring the trust of airline passengers, many of whom say they won't fly on a Max even if regulators clear the troubled plane to fly again. "He's got his work cut out for him," Hamilton says. For doing that job, Calhoun will earn a salary of $1.4 million, plus a $7 million bonus if and when the Max is recertified and other benchmarks are met. In all, he could earn nearly $30 million with all the stock options, incentives and bonuses Boeing is offering. In an email to Boeing employees on Monday, Calhoun said returning the 737 Max to service safely is among his top priorities for the company in 2020. "This company has a tremendous legacy of aerospace achievement, thanks to your efforts and the contributions of generations before you," he said. "I honor that legacy, and I appreciate your tireless commitment. I also recognize the learnings — many of them painful — from the experiences of the last 18 months that you are bringing to the way we do business." Meanwhile, the company has announced that Calhoun's predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, is walking out with more than $62 million in compensation. In a statement, Boeing says that is what Muilenburg is contractually entitled to receive. Boeing said he is not receiving severance pay or a bonus, and he has returned nearly $15 million worth of stock options. Still, that's a hefty payout for someone who one of the families of those killed in the plane crash says failed to do his job, which is to keep airline passengers safe. "He shouldn't get any reward for killing people," Nadia Milleron says. "He should actually go to jail rather that get a reward."

 John Kapoor, founder of Arizona-based Insys Therapeutics, is scheduled to be sentenced this month. Sentencing is scheduled to begin on Monday in the criminal trial of top executives at Insys Therapeutics. This landmark case was the first successful prosecution of high-ranking pharmaceutical executives linked to the opioid crisis, including onetime billionaire John Kapoor. After a 10-week trial and 15 days of jury deliberations, Kapoor and his four co-defendants were found guilty of racketeering conspiracy in May 2019. This charge is often used to prosecute drug dealers and mob bosses. However, this was a rare case in which the federal government used racketeering to go after corporate executives. The Insys executives were found guilty of running a nationwide bribery scheme. The case centered on a potent opioid painkiller, Subsys, that Insys developed and aggressively marketed. Federal prosecutors argued that from 2012 to 2015, the company paid doctors to prescribe the opioid in high doses and give it to patients who did not necessarily need it. They did this through inviting doctors with a history of liberally prescribing opioids to participate in a sham "speakers program." The federal prosecutors said the doctors were paid well for "speaking" if they wrote a lot of prescriptions for Subsys, even if nobody showed up to the lectures. Insys representatives then systematically lied to insurance companies in an effort to ensure that their painkiller, which could cost as much as $19,000 per month, would be covered. Kapoor's defense attorneys argued that he was unaware of the illegal activities. They blamed executives who pleaded guilty and cooperated with the prosecutors. The jury was not convinced and found Kapoor and his co-defendants guilty. However, seven months later, the Massachusetts federal judge overseeing the case struck down part of the jury's verdict. U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs said the evidence was insufficient to prove the jury's conclusion that Insys executives intended that doctors prescribe the opioid when it was not medically needed. Burroughs said the evidence indicated that the defendants did not care about the medical necessity of the drug, but it did not prove their intent. "The Court only very reluctantly disturbs a jury verdict, but finds it necessary to do so here," Burroughs wrote in her ruling. While she overturned the jury's finding that the defendants violated the Controlled Substances Act, she denied the defendants' request for a new trial, and the defendants were still guilty of other acts, including mail fraud and wire fraud. When federal prosecutors brought charges against Insys executives, experts saw it as the federal government seeking to hold drug companies accountable for their part in the opioid epidemic. The judge's decision to overturn part of the Insys verdict was interpreted as an indication that federal prosecutors may be overreaching. Outside the trial, Insys Therapeutics has faced turbulent times. A month after the Insys executives were found guilty, the company reached a $225 million settlement with the Justice Department. As part of the agreement, the company acknowledged bribing doctors and agreed to close federal monitoring. Five days later, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Amid it all, Insys replaced its CEO, Saeed Motahari, with Andrew Long. Six months later, Long stepped down. The sentencings are scheduled to take place over two weeks, beginning Monday and concluding on Jan. 23. Federal prosecutors recommended that Kapoor be sentenced to 15 years in prison, while his lawyers suggested a year of prison time. Kapoor's sentencing is slated for Jan. 23. Prosecutors recommended prison terms between six and 11 years for the other former Insys executives — Michael Gurry, Richard Simon, Joseph Rowan and Sunrise Lee. For two former executives, Michael Babich and Alec Burlakoff, who testified for the prosecution, the government recommended 66 months and 60 months, respectively. Attorneys for the executives all requested a combination of probation, home confinement and no more than a year of prison time.
The Kratom Debate: Helpful Herb Or Dangerous Drug?,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/01/13/789145948/the-kratom-debate-helpful-herb-or-dangerous-drug,January 13, 2020,

 Kratom products are legal in most states and are widely available. But the federal Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration worry that kratom carries the risk of physical and psychological dependency and, in some people, addiction. Americans know the dangers of drugs such as morphine and heroin. But what about a supplement that acts in the brain a bit like an opiate and is available in many places to kids — even from vending machines. Kratom, an herb that's abundant, legal in most states and potentially dangerous, is the subject of an ongoing debate over its risks and benefits. Usually, the leaf, which comes from a tropical Southeast Asian tree, is chewed, brewed or crushed into a bitter green powder. The chemicals in the herb interact with different types of receptors in the brain — some that respond to opioids, and others to stimulants. Often sold in the U.S. in a processed form — as pills, capsules or extracts — a small amount of kratom can perk you up, while a large dose has a sedative effect. Some people who have struggled with an opioid addiction and switched to kratom swear the substance salvaged their health, livelihood and relationships. But the federal Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration worry that kratom carries the risk of physical and psychological dependency and, in some people, addiction. The FDA warns consumers not to use kratom, and the DEA threatened to prohibit kratom's sale and use in the U.S. (outside of research) in 2016; advocates and lawmakers subsequently pushed back, and the stricter scheduling of kratom that would have prompted that sort of ban never occurred. These days, the DEA lists it as a drug of concern. Like "a little glass of wine" 
                Linda Kline owns Bumble Bee Botanicals, which sells kratom in five upscale shops throughout the West, including this one in San Francisco. All her products are lab tested to ensure purity, Kline says.

 Linda Kline owns Bumble Bee Botanicals, which sells kratom in five upscale shops throughout the West, including this one in San Francisco. All her products are lab tested to ensure purity, Kline says. Linda Kline, 33, based in Reno, Nev., sells kratom for a living. She says her several stores throughout the West have given her a new purpose in life. And while she herself doesn't have an opioid dependency, she credits kratom with turning around her mental health. "I went from feeling desperate and hopeless to finding an alternative where I had full control over how I felt," she says. She used to be paralyzed by anxiety and panic attacks. When her insurance carrier threatened to cut her Prozac prescription, she felt desperate. A friend suggested kratom, so she picked some up at a smoke shop. "It almost feels like you're having just a little glass of wine," Kline says. "It's really relaxing. There's no melting of the walls." The new habit cost about $6 a day — less than a glass of wine or fancy cup of coffee. But Kline says she couldn't always find a high-quality supply. The FDA has recalled dozens of salmonella-tainted products sold online or in convenience stores. The agency has also found toxic heavy metals in kratom supplements. That's one reason Kline started her own chic boutiques, Bumble Bee Botanicals, devoted exclusively to kratom products that, she says, are all lab tested to ensure purity. She just opened her fifth location in less than two years. The shops offer 15 kratom strains at outlets in California, Idaho and Nevada. Though Kline's website has a disclaimer that her products have not been evaluated by the FDA and "are not intended to cure, treat or prevent any disease/illness," some of her clients' online Yelp reviews claim kratom has dramatically relieved their chronic pain, insomnia, restless legs syndrome and more.

 Gold Bali is a strain of kratom sold at Bumble Bee Botanicals in San Francisco. "It almost feels like you're having just a little glass of wine," Kline says of kratom. "It's really relaxing." Potential dangers Glowing reviews like that haunt Mateo Martinez. "My brother believed the marketing of kratom — that it was a natural herbal supplement that could provide you with the same benefits of an opioid without the risks," Mateo says. Mateo's younger brother, Marco, struggled with an opioid addiction in high school. Mateo describes Marco as a charismatic, creative teen, passionate about video games, cartoons and anime. Marco got hooked on painkillers, Mateo says, after his dentist pulled his wisdom teeth. "He was using them in a way that wasn't just for treating pain," Mateo says. Email receipts show Marco used bitcoin to also buy Vicodin and fentanyl on the dark web. Eventually Marco wanted to kick his opioid addiction and saw testimonials on YouTube and Reddit that promised that kratom could be a way out. Soon Marco was popping kratom capsules multiple times a day. During his freshman year at the University of California, Davis, the 19-year-old started hyperventilating regularly. The incidents worsened, becoming seizure-like episodes and ending in trips to the emergency room. During each hospitalization, the doctors were stumped. No one thought to test for kratom. Marco died in his UC Davis dorm in February 2018, late on a Sunday night. The toxicology report listed "acute mitragynine intoxication" — a chemical constituent of kratom — as the cause of death. "I think kratom needs to come with a much more serious caution that it is not harmless," Mateo says. "I'm very heartbroken." In a recent 18-month period, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 90 kratom overdoses, although most involved a combination of other substances too. Slim science, so far "The data to support either the benefits or the harms for kratom is really, really poor," says C. Michael White, head of the Department of Pharmacy Practice at the University of Connecticut. "A lot of the information we have comes from single-case reports." White says that animal studies suggest kratom could be an effective pain reliever, but the collection of human data has only just begun. He says scientists need to conduct a lot more research before the appropriate level of regulation is clear. White recently argued in the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy that the safest place for kratom is behind pharmacy counters, for adults only, but with no prescription required. McClain Haddow, spokesperson for the American Kratom Association, agrees that the product should be sold only to people over age 18. "We would like vendors to register their product with the FDA and get a chemical analysis from a certified lab to insure the only ingredient is the naturally occurring alkaloid in the kratom plant," Haddow says. "Some manufacturers are spiking products with fentanyl, heroin or morphine to give users a high." Dr. Scott Steiger, deputy medical director of the opiate treatment outpatient program at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, says he doesn't know how to advise patients who want to use kratom. "I tell them I just don't know enough on the basis of science to tell them whether it's a great idea or not," says Steiger, who is also an associate clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. The DEA describes kratom as an addictive substance that causes hallucinations, delusion and confusion. "I have seen that people who use kratom end up having a very hard time stopping the use of it," says Steiger. His patients report withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, sweats, aches and pains, loose stool, tearing and dysphoria. There is growing concern about kratom's effects on the heart and liver. Steiger emphasizes that doctors have evidence-based treatments like buprenorphine and methadone to help people with an opioid addiction. He doesn't recommend self-medicating with kratom until more research is available. "We just don't know enough about this chemical and the long-term use of it to know whether experimenting would lead to complications," Steiger says.

 Tourists, wearing face masks due to heavy smoke, take a selfie at Sydney Harbour on Dec. 19, 2019. As news of Australia's wildfires spreads around the world, fewer tourists are arriving in the country. Australia calls itself the Lucky Country, a nation so fortunate in geography and natural resources that it hasn't had a recession in nearly three decades. But the deadly wildfires raging through large parts of the country are slowing tourism and other key sectors that contribute to its impressive economic growth. "Just the area of Australia that's now impacted is unheard of. So we are in uncertain territory," says Martin North, principal at the research firm Digital Finance Analytics. The wildfires have killed more than two dozen people more than a billion animals. They've destroyed more than 1,800 houses, an untold number of commercial buildings and thousands of acres of prime farmland, according to the Insurance Council of Australia. Insurance losses so far have totaled nearly a half billion dollars, but the numbers are likely to rise sharply, says Campbell Fuller, the council's head of communications. "For [the fires] to burn across such a wide area, over such an extensive period, is uncommon. In fact, it's unprecedented to have that number of bushfires burning concurrently," he says. The fires have damaged two pillars of the Australian economy: the agricultural sector, which was already weakened by a severe drought, and the all-important tourism industry. Winter in the Northern Hemisphere is peak tourist season in Australia, when visitors from Asia and Europe flock to the country, eager to soak up the sun and enjoy the country's outdoor lifestyle. As news of the wildfires spreads around the world, fewer tourists are arriving and those who do come have had to endure less-than-ideal conditions. Even in Sydney, far from the fires, skies are so smoky that fire alarms have gone off in office buildings. Ferry service in the city's world-famous harbor has sometimes been canceled because of poor visibility. The campground run by Fiona Austin in Shoalhaven, south of Sydney, is usually full this time of year, but tourists were ordered to evacuate, and only a few people remain. "It's affected a lot of businesses, and I can't see people coming back at the moment when the fires are still burning," Austin told NPR's Jason Beaubien. The fires mark something of a change of fortune for the Australian economy, sometimes called the Wonder Down Under. The country has benefited enormously from its proximity to Asia, says Justin Wolfers, an Australian native who is a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. "Not only did we start the last few decades a relatively rich country in the club of the first-world industrialized countries, we're also parked right next to Asia, which is where much of the world's growth has come from over the past few years," Wolfers says. China, in particular, has been hungry for the kinds of commodities Australia has a lot of, such as coal, natural gas, wheat and wool, and it sends more tourists to Australia than any other country. Wolfers says the Australian government has also demonstrated more skill than other countries at navigating the challenges of the global economy, like the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. While the U.S. Congress was squabbling over how to address the Great Recession, the Canberra government was acting swiftly to stimulate spending and cut interest rates, he says. Unlike other industrialized countries, Australia has experienced a steady rise in population, largely because of immigration, so even in slow times the economy has kept growing, Wolfers adds. Some of that growth has eased in recent years, as China's economy has slowed. Australian consumers are spending less, and housing prices, which have skyrocketed in recent years, have fallen. "The growth levels in Australia are lower than they've been in a very long time," North says. "We were already looking ... pretty shaky and that was before all of the bushfires." One potential problem is that many Australians haven't updated their insurance policies over the years or have let them lapse altogether, he notes. Australia has suffered through catastrophic fires before, such as the 2009 conflagration in Victoria, which did billions of dollars in damage. But the current fires are affecting a much bigger area, and they've also begun earlier, making it hard to assess how much they'll cost. "What's really concerning to us is that this is still relatively early in our typical bushfire season" and there are worries about how much longer it will last, says economist Katrina Ell of Moody's Analytics. Ell doesn't think a recession is likely, but North isn't as sure. The fires started in relatively unpopulated areas, but they're moving closer to the cities, where they can do a lot more damage, he says.
New Law Aims To Help Americans Without Retirement Plans. Will It Work?,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/11/794619987/new-law-aims-to-help-americans-without-retirement-plans-will-it-work,January 11, 2020,

 The Secure Act aims to make it easier for small employers to offer retirement benefits. But some analysts say the new law doesn't go far enough because it's optional and doesn't apply to gig workers. The most powerful way to get people to save for retirement in recent decades has been through benefits offered at their job. But a lot of people — about half the American workforce — don't get that from their employers. "Over 50 million workers right now don't have access to any retirement plan at all," says David Certner, legislative counsel for AARP.  Small employers are the biggest segment lacking coverage, he says. That's because many small businesses lack the time and money to set such programs up, he says. The new law, called the Secure Act, aims to help with that, in part by allowing smaller employers to band together to share the administrative burden — making it cheaper and easier to offer retirement benefits. How many will do so and expand their retirement benefits is far from clear because the program is optional. And, Certner says, the law won't apply to many other workers who aren't classified as employees. Contractors or gig workers aren't eligible for those benefits. The Secure Act also gives people more flexibility to save for longer periods of time and delay withdrawing funds. It allows employers to offer other investment options like annuities. The fact that the measure passed with overwhelming bipartisan support last month is significant, says Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. But she says the changes are modest. She notes that the government has tried — and largely failed — to encourage more small businesses to offer retirement benefits through programs like the Treasury Department's now-expired myRA program.  She expects it will be the same with this latest law. "I don't really think they're really going to move the needle much at all," Munnell says. The new law requires employers offering retirement benefits to include part-time workers who've been on the job at least three years. That could help about 4 million workers, Munnell says. Much bigger changes to retirement law have been occurring at the state level, experts say. Ten states — including Oregon, California and Illinois — recently started requiring private employers to enroll their workers in individual retirement accounts if the employers don't offer their own benefits. Those state programs are expected to expand retirement savings to 15 million more people. "Without a mandate, without somebody saying, 'Mr. Small Businessman, you have to do something for your employees,' I don't think we're going to see much change," Munnell says. That's why, she says, she would like to see such rules extend to all 50 states.

 Women got the lion's share of new jobs in December and now outnumber men on U.S. payrolls. This unusual situation reflects the growth of industries like health care where women dominate. Job growth slowed last month as U.S. employers added just 145,000 jobs. But there was an interesting milestone in Friday's report from the Labor Department. Ninety-five percent of the net jobs added in December went to women. Women now hold just over half of all payroll jobs in America, for only the second time in history. The first was during the Great Recession, when a wave of layoffs hit male workers first, temporarily giving women an edge in the workplace. The period was even dubbed the Mancession.  Before long, though, women were hit with their own layoffs. And their numerical advantage didn't last. This time could be different, because women's gains come from being hired at a faster pace than men. "I feel very strongly that a year from now, their share will continue to be over 50%," says Betsey Stevenson, a University of Michigan economist who served in the Obama administration.     Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. (Importantly, the Labor Department's count of payroll workers excludes both farmers and the self-employed. Men still dominate both of those categories.) The growing number of women on company payrolls reflects a long-running evolution away from male-dominated industries like manufacturing toward the service side of the economy, where women have an edge. "That's what the U.S. does. We're a service-sector economy," Stevenson says. "The service sector is really broad. It's not just about serving coffee or taking care of children." Serving coffee and taking care of children are big businesses, though. The hospitality industry alone added 40,000 jobs in December. Women hold 77% of the jobs in health care and education — fast-growing fields that eclipse the entire goods-producing sector of the economy. "The sectors that typically tend to employ men, like mining, manufacturing — those have all been in decline," says Megan Greene, a senior fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Factories shed 12,000 jobs in December while mining and logging lost 9,000. Construction is one male-dominated field that showed growth last month, adding 20,000 jobs. "The low interest rates we've been seeing recently has generated more of a housing boom than we expected at the beginning of the year," says White House economist Tom Philipson. But Greene says the U.S. is likely to keep adding jobs faster in industries where women have traditionally played an outsize role. That could be a factor keeping wage gains in check, since women often work in lower-wage industries, and they tend to earn less than men. "If we're adding most of our jobs at the low end of the pay scale, we're not getting much upward pressure on wages," Greene says. "And that's I think why wages have been so frustratingly low in this recovery." Over the last year, average wages rose just 2.9%, even though unemployment is at a 50-year low. On the positive side, the growing number of women in the workplace is likely to reshape demand for things like flexible hours and paid family leave, which working men might appreciate as well. "The bigger the footprint women have, the harder it is to say this is a fringe group that wants a fringe benefit, and the labor market won't stand for it," Stevenson says. In some ways it's only a footnote that women's share of payroll jobs went from just below 50% in November to just above that threshold last month.  But in other ways, it's a watershed. "It reminds us to take a moment and think about the kind of strides women have made in the labor market," Stevenson says. "But also, the future of the labor force is going to involve greater women's equality." For years now, Stevenson says, women have been outpacing men in education.  That investment should pay more dividends for the economy, as women's numbers grow in the workplace.

 A Boeing 737 Max airplane being built for Norwegian Air International taxis for a test flight, at Renton Municipal Airport in Renton, Wash. Jet parts maker Spirit AeroSystems announced Friday it was laying off thousands of employees, the latest impact of the halt in production of Boeing's troubled 737 Max planes.   The Wichita-based company said the staff cuts will affect roughly 2,800 employees. It said it came to the decision because it is unclear when Boeing will resume making the once in-demand aircraft.  Boeing's Max planes have been grounded worldwide since March, following a pair of deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed a combined 346 people.  News of the Spirit AeroSystems layoffs comes a day after Boeing released a batch of internal documents, including emails from employees mocking staff at the Federal Aviation Administration and showing disdain for architects of the jetliner.  One email said, "This airplane is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys." Spirit AeroSystems calls itself a "significant supplier" to the Max program, building parts including thrust reversers, wing components, engine pylons and the entire fuselage. The company added "the MAX represents more than 50 percent of Spirit's annual revenue." "The difficult decision announced today is a necessary step given the uncertainty related to both the timing for resuming 737 MAX production and the overall production levels that can be expected following the production suspension," Spirit AeroSystems President and CEO Tom Gentile said in a statement.  "We are taking these actions to balance the interests of all of our stakeholders as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, while also positioning Spirit to meet future demand."  Boeing announced last month it was suspending production of its 737 Max as of January. The company said at the time it did not plan to layoff  or furlough Boeing workers who build the plane, but would reassign them. But as NPR has reported, the cease in production was expected to reverberate throughout Boeing's extensive supply chain. Spirit AeroSystems said this week it was seeking voluntary layoffs, according to Nadya Faulx, a reporter at member station KMUW.  She tells NPR, "In addition to work on the 737, Spirit also builds parts for the Boeing 787, and 767, and parts for various Airbus jets at multiple facilities worldwide."  Spirit AeroSystems also plans additional smaller layoffs at its plants in Tulsa and McAlester, Okla., later this month.  Spirit AeroSystems said late last month, it had received a directive "to stop all 737 MAX deliveries to Boeing" effective at the start of the new year.  Three days after that announcement, Boeing ousted CEO Dennis Muilenburg, citing the need "to restore confidence in the Company moving forward as it works to repair relationships with regulators, customers, and all other stakeholders."  David Calhoun, Boeing's new chief executive, starts on Monday.

 Workers assemble cars at Ford's newly renovated assembly plant in Chicago. Factories lost 12,000 jobs in December. The manufacturing sector has been hard hit by the trade war as well as slowing demand overseas. Updated at 10:53 a.m. ET Hiring slowed somewhat in December, as U.S. employers added 145,000 jobs.  According to the Labor Department, that's down slightly from the three previous months, when employers added an average of 200,000 jobs. But the unemployment rate held steady at 3.5%, matching its lowest level in 50 years.  For all of 2019, the economy added 2.1 million jobs — the slowest pace of annual job growth since 2011. Job gains for October and November were revised down by a total of 14,000.   Average wages have increased  2.9% over the last year, outpacing inflation and boosting workers' buying power. Wage gains are still relatively modest, however, given the rock-bottom jobless rate.  That suggests there may be more slack in the labor market than the unemployment figure would indicate. The share of Americans in their prime working years — from 25 to 54 — who are either employed or looking for work is still lower than it was two decades ago. Overall, participation in the labor force was 63.2% in December, unchanged from the month before.   Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here.  Steady job gains, coupled with wage increases, are expected to keep fueling consumer spending in 2020. Consumers have been the most reliable drivers in the U.S. economy as business investment has faded.   Factories lost 12,000 jobs last month. The manufacturing sector has been hard hit by the trade war as well as slowing demand overseas. An index of manufacturing activity fell in December to its lowest level in more than a decade.  By contrast, the much larger services sector — which includes everything from health care and hospitality to transportation and finance — has been more insulated from global shocks. Service sector activity accelerated in December. And service-sector jobs accounted for 97% of December's new hires.   Health care continued to show solid growth, with 28,000 jobs added last month. Retailers, who have struggled in recent months, added 41,000 jobs.   Excluding the self-employed, women outnumbered men on the employment rolls in December for the first time since 2010. That reflects the growth in female-dominated fields such as education and hospitality, and the decline in manufacturing.

 Grounded Boeing 737 Max airplanes crowd a parking area in Seattle in June. Updated at 9:58 p.m. ET The latest documents Boeing has released related to the design and certification of the 737 Max paint a dark picture of employee reactions to problems that came up during the development of the now-grounded airliners. The documents include emails and internal communications. In one message, employees mock the Federal Aviation Administration and brag about getting regulators to approve the jets without requiring much additional pilot training. In another document, an employee ridicules colleagues involved in the development of the troubled plane, saying, "This airplane is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys." Crashes of 737 Max airliners in 2018 and 2019 killed a total of 346 people. Some of the most concerning messages involve discussions of problems with the company's Max flight simulators in which the company employees suggest they misled regulators about potential problems with the Max. "I still haven't been forgiven by God for the covering up I did last year," one employee says in 2018, referring to an exchange of information with the FAA. Another damning exchange calls into question the safety of the 737 Max long before the plane was approved to fly passengers. "Would you put your family on a Max simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn't," says one employee to another, who responds, "No." House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., called newly released documents "incredibly damning," adding that "they paint a deeply disturbing picture of the lengths Boeing was apparently willing to go to in order to evade scrutiny from regulators, flight crews, and the flying public, even as its own employees were sounding alarms internally." A Boeing official said the communications were written by a small number of employees, primarily Boeing technical pilots and personnel involved with the development and qualification of Boeing's 737 Max simulators. Some of them are the same employees involved in sending other damaging emails and internal messages that were disclosed last year. The company official said the language used and sentiments expressed in these communications "are inconsistent with Boeing values, and the company is taking appropriate action in response." The FAA reviewed the documents for safety implications. "Our experts determined that nothing in the submission pointed to any safety risks that were not already identified as part of the ongoing review of proposed modifications to the aircraft," the FAA said in a statement. The statement goes on to call the tone and some of the language contained in the documents "disappointing, [but] the FAA remains focused on following a thorough process for returning the Boeing 737 MAX to passenger service."
Tell Me A Story: What Narratives Reveal About The Mind,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/09/794683840/tell-me-a-story-what-narratives-reveal-about-the-mind,January 9, 2020, Writers and filmmakers hoping to hoodwink their fans with plot twists have long known what cognitive scientists know: All of us have blind spots in the way we assess the world. We get distracted. We forget how we know things. We see patterns that aren't there. Because these blind spots are wired into the brain, they act in ways that are predictable — so predictable that storytellers from Sophocles to M. Night Shyamalan have used them to lead us astray. In recent years, some scientists have begun to ask, can stories serve as a kind of brain scan? If a plot twist works by exploiting our biases and mental shortcuts, can observing the mechanics of a good story reveal something important about the contours of the mind?" "Stories are a kind of magic trick," says Case Western Reserve University's professor Vera Tobin. "When we dissect them, we can discover very, very reliable aspects of those tricks that turn out to be important clues about the way that people think." But stories aren't just found in books or plays or clever plot twists in movies. They can also be found in the stuff we buy.  In the second half of the episode, we talk to professor of marketing Americus Reed. Today, he teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. But when he was 17, he was the new kid — one of a handful of black students bused to a predominantly white school. He wanted to be accepted. So he came up with a plan: He would become a social chameleon. "I sort of settled on this idea that I would try to be...a boundary-spanner," he says. "So I hung out with the nerds, I hung out with the jocks, I hung out with the musicians." As he spent time with these different cliques, he noticed that each had its own set of badges, its own language. And he realized that if he could speak that language, adopt those badges, he would start to blend in. So he started wearing the things the other kids wore. With the athletes it was Nikes. With the musicians, Chuck Taylors. With the hip hop kids, Adidas – but without the shoelaces. It was like a costume, but deeper.  "A brand is so much more than a tagline or a logo," he says.

 The Trump administration wants to overhaul a major environmental law — the National Environmental Policy Act — to help speed approval of infrastructure projects, including oil and gas pipelines. Updated at 1:40 E.T. In one of his most sweeping environmental proposals so far, President Trump says he wants to streamline an "outrageously slow and burdensome federal approval process" that can delay major infrastructure projects for years.  Supporters from the fossil fuel, construction, ranching and other industries welcome the move, which they've long sought. Environmental groups warn it would sideline the climate impacts of highways, pipelines and other projects, and they promise a legal challenge. The proposal would put new limits on implementation of the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, which has not been updated in decades. As one of the country's bedrock environmental laws, it requires federal agencies to consider the environmental effects of proposed projects before they are approved. It also gives the public and interest groups the ability to comment on those evaluations.  "America is a nation of builders," Trump said announcing the move at the White House, whose "gleaming new infrastructure" used to be the envy of the world. Now, he said, too much red tape has delayed some projects and left others in dire need of updating, making the U.S. "like a Third World country. It's really sad." A key part of the administration's proposal centers on whether agencies must consider the cumulative environmental effects of things like pipelines, which have attracted protests by climate activists across the country. Under the new limits, federal agencies would only need to consider effects that are "reasonably foreseeable" and have a "close causal relationship" to the project. That could mean simply the impact of building the pipeline.  Environmental groups say agencies should also consider the impact of the oil and gas that would flow through it, to help the country plan for limiting the carbon dioxide emissions that warm the climate.  Mary Neumayr, chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, says the average times for agencies to complete an environmental impact statement is 4 1/2 years, and it is even longer for highway projects, which average seven years.  This delay, she says, "deprives Americans of the benefits of modernized bridges and roads that enable them to get home to their families."  Industry groups say streamlining NEPA regulations would lead to more and better-paying jobs, as long-delayed projects could be built. In a letter to the administration last year, they said every $1 billion spent on infrastructure leads to 13,000 jobs.  Environmental groups also criticize a proposed two-year time limit for agencies to issue comprehensive environmental impact statements and restrictions on public comments, including topics covered and how quickly they have to be submitted.  The proposal would also give federal agencies more power to resolve disputes that could delay a project and limit the projects that are subject to NEPA review.  For example, it would exempt "non-federal" projects with little government funding. In another controversial change, companies could essentially conduct their own environmental reviews.  "This is a clearly a conflict of interest," says Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president at Center for American Progress. She was a managing director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality during the Obama administration.  "It's baffling that the Trump administration thinks handing the keys of environmental review to big polluters is going to pass muster," says Goldfuss.  The White House CEQ will collect public comments for at least 60 days before making the rule final. But there are hurdles that could keep it from taking effect.   For one thing, if Trump loses his re-election bid, it's likely that the next president will drop the revised rules. Even if he wins, environmental groups are expected to file legal challenges. And experts point out that the actual underlying law remains the same.   "The law require federal agencies to report the environmental impacts of their actions that significantly affect 'the quality of the human environment,' " says Bruce Huber of Notre Dame Law School. "If the regulations announced today drive agencies to diminish the extent or quality of their reporting, federal courts may very well conclude that their reports do not comply with the law."  
U-Haul's Nicotine-Free Hiring Rule Reflects A Trend That Troubles Workers' Advocates,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/01/09/794685174/u-hauls-nicotine-free-hiring-rule-reflects-a-trend-that-troubles-workers-advocat,January 9, 2020,

 People who smoke, vape or use nicotine in any form will not be hired by U-Haul in the 21 states where such hiring policies are legal. When U-Haul recently announced it will no longer hire people who use nicotine in any form in the 21 states where such hiring policies are legal, the Phoenix-based moving company joined a cadre of companies with nicotine-free hiring policies.   U-Haul's announcement is receiving outsize attention because nicotine-free hiring policies are more common at high-profile hospitals such as Cleveland Clinic that are especially protective of their healthy image.  Alaska Airlines has one of the oldest nicotine-free hiring policies, going back to 1985. But at the time, a big part of the stated reasoning was that the industry isn't conducive to taking smoke breaks.  Now, some employers are making the policy change simply citing health concerns or health care costs — even the city of Dayton, Ohio, has joined the movement. But the policies are raising concern around labor and medical ethics. Harald Schmidt, a medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, says targeting smokers disproportionately harms poor people. "To me, this is more about fair equality of opportunity," he says. Smoking is a behavior, so Schmidt doesn't equate it with discriminating on the basis of race, gender or sexual orientation. But he notes that nearly half of unemployed people smoke. And quitting is hard, because many are addicted.  "You're basically posing a double whammy on them," he says. "It's very hard for them to get work, and it's even harder for people who are already in a vulnerable situation." Karen Buesing of the law firm Akerman represents employers and works with them on smoking policies. She says employers are looking out for the health of their employees.  Employers do have some concern about productivity and absenteeism, she says. But it's more about the risks of cancer and heart and lung disease.  "Obviously, there are higher health care costs associated with smokers. And so many companies would much prefer to have a nonsmoking workforce," she says. The corporate cost per smoker is estimated to be in the thousands of dollars per year, though some experts have questioned the accuracy of the figures. Buesing says discrimination of any kind is so taboo that employers in many states don't realize they can reject applicants for being smokers. And it's not allowed everywhere: 29 states and the District of Columbia have various laws that safeguard "off-duty" activity. Many of these laws were passed in recent decades specifically to shield smokers.  "In that context, you now have protections for smokers," Buesing says of the 29 states. "Certainly under federal law, smokers are not a protected class." A 2017 Gallup Poll found that more than half of American smokers feel they're discriminated against for their nicotine habit. "Even when I was doing temporary work, people would be like, 'You're going on break? Are you going to smoke?' " says Carl Carter of Nashville, Tenn., who is currently on disability benefits and not working. "I should have the right to do what I want to do." It's not that he doesn't want to quit. He has tried eight times, most recently on New Year's Day. But the habit is hard to beat. Labor groups have not fought nicotine-free hiring policies, but Edgar Ndjatou, executive director of the advocacy nonprofit Workplace Fairness, calls smoker hiring bans "problematic." "Someone who uses tobacco could potentially have some form of disability," he says, adding that addiction could be protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act. "I would argue that these types of bans have to be reasoned." Ndjatou and other critics ask, what's next? Will nicotine-free hiring lead to more policing of worker health?  IT administrator and vaper Scott Bales thinks so.  "I think that it's interesting that they are demonizing one over the other, and I'll specifically use alcohol," he says on a vaping break outside his office in Nashville. "How can you ban one substance without banning the other one?" The American Civil Liberties Union has come out against nicotine-free hiring, calling it "discrimination." The organization is critical of other forms of  what it calls "lifestyle discrimination."  "Should an employer be able to forbid an employee from going skiing? or riding a bicycle? or sunbathing on a Saturday afternoon?" an ACLU legislative briefing asks. "All of these activities entail a health risk."  But companies rejecting smokers point out that tobacco is the most preventable cause of cancer and lung disease. And the employers are the ones who will likely have to pay much of the bills.  Still, attorney Buesing doesn't expect the U-Haul announcement to unleash a flood of similar policies. She says rewarding healthy behavior is still seen as the most palatable approach by many employers. U-Haul says its policy will not apply to existing workers. The company employs 30,000 people around the country with 4,000 at its headquarters. Going forward, U-Haul will screen new hires and require them to consent to future drug testing for nicotine, though it's unclear how that would affect workers who use nicotine gum or patches.  "This policy is a responsible step in fostering a culture of wellness at U-Haul, with the goal of helping our Team Members on their health journey," chief of staff Jessica Lopez said in a press release. U-Haul declined NPR's interview request. This story comes from NPR's reporting partnership with Nashville Public Radio and Kaiser Health News. 
Minimum Wage Hikes Fuel Higher Pay Growth For Those At The Bottom,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/09/794280616/minimum-wage-hikes-fuel-higher-pay-growth-for-those-at-the-bottom,January 9, 2020,

 Airport employees, Uber and Lyft drivers, and other workers protest for a $15 minimum wage at Los Angeles International Airport in October. Increases in minimum wages contributed to bigger pay gains for lower-income workers. Kecia Jolley is getting a pay raise this week. But she's still making minimum wage. Jolley works as a grocery store cashier in Missouri — one of nearly two dozen states that increased their minimum wages on Jan. 1. Economists say those mandatory wage hikes are an important factor boosting pay for workers at the bottom of the income ladder. Jolley's Friday paycheck will be the first to reflect Missouri's 2020 minimum of $9.45 an hour, up from $8.60 last year. "I think that I'll be better off," she says. "But I think that it's going to still be a struggle." Jolley says her paycheck will still barely cover rent and utilities. She relies on food stamps and school lunches to help feed her three children — ages 6, 11 and 14. Jolley is grateful that a ballot measure passed by Missouri voters in 2018 calls for three additional increases in the minimum wage over the next three years. By 2023, the minimum will climb to $12 an hour. "I would consider that at least a decent living wage," Jolley says. "Then people can pay their bills. They can possibly get a few things on their 'wants' list every month. Like, kids need new clothes. Or — I'm a girl. I ran out of mascara, like, a month ago. Luxury items such as new socks." While the federal minimum wage hasn't changed in more than a decade — it's still $7.25 an hour — many cities and states have adopted higher thresholds. In Arizona, Colorado and Maine the minimum wage is already $12 an hour. Minimums are higher still in California, Massachusetts and Washington state.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. "If you're a minimum wage worker in America right now, on average, you're actually probably getting paid closer to $12 an hour," says economist Ernie Tedeschi of Evercore ISI. "That's what I call the effective minimum wage." Tedeschi says rising minimums at the state and local level are an important driver of wage gains at the bottom of the pay scale. "Right now, the economy is doing something extraordinary," he says. "People at the bottom of the distribution have actually seen higher wage growth than people at the top and in the middle."  Crunching census data, Tedeschi finds workers in the bottom third of the income ladder have enjoyed pay raises of about 4.1% in each of the last two years, compared with 3.6% raises for the top third and 3.9% for all workers. Minimum wages aren't the only factor. Low-wage workers also have more bargaining power, as employers scramble to fill job openings when unemployment is just 3.5%. Right now, the economy is doing something extraordinary. People at the bottom of the distribution have actually seen higher wage growth than people at the top and in the middle. Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at Evercore ISI But without the upward pressure of rising minimum wages, Tedeschi estimates the bottom third would have received raises averaging just 3.3%. "Minimum wages probably are the difference that are kicking up wage growth at the bottom to higher levels than other groups in America," he says. The patchwork of minimum wages across the country creates a sort of natural experiment for economists trying to measure the effects on low-wage workers.   "No matter how you cut it, the low-wage workers are getting a larger wage boost in states that have raised their minimum wage," says senior economist Elise Gould of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. Gould estimates the higher minimums that took effect this month boosted paychecks for 6.8 million workers across the country. But others caution that the higher cost for employers may come with trade-offs. "You're getting a raise if you keep your job and if your hours don't change," says economist David Neumark of the University of California at Irvine. "But there's plenty of evidence that there is some job loss from minimum wages and those workers are worse off." Neumark acknowledges that job loss associated with minimum wage hikes may be less of a problem when unemployment is this low.   "Raising it in a very hot labor market is probably less damaging," Neumark says. More high school students and others "might be drawn in because wages are rising," he says. "And if a few of them have job opportunities foreclosed, it might not be so terrible." Jolley hasn't seen any job cuts at the grocery store where she works. The cashier doubts she would be getting a raise were it not required by the higher minimum. "We still need to keep pushing forward because, hopefully, people like me will be able to actually make it every month," she says. 
Want To Quit Your Job? Here's How To Do It Well,https://www.npr.org/2019/12/30/792426201/want-to-quit-your-job-heres-how-to-do-it-well,January 9, 2020, Falling out of love with your job? Unmotivated about work? Maybe you're even  fantasizing about your epic mic-drop resignation. If you're experiencing feelings along this spectrum, pay attention to them! The sooner you start planning your exit, the better, because quitting a job out of anger or on impulse (even if it sounds satisfying in the moment) will only hurt you. In fact, there are ways to leave your job that could actually help build your reputation and set you up for success in your next role. Think building bridges, not burning them. Listen to Life Kit This story is adapted from an episode of Life Kit, NPR's podcast with tools to help you get it together. Listen to the podcast at the top of the page, or find it here. J.T. O'Donnell, founder of the career coaching site Work It Daily, has decades of experience in human resources and advising workers on job transitions. She says people often get too emotional when it comes to their work. "So many people, when they get to the point of, 'I need to quit,' " O'Donnell says, "they're super emotional. You don't just get emotional overnight." If you're starting to feel disenchanted with your boss or you no longer see a path for growth, recognize that feeling early and let it spur you to action. O'Donnell says most people start planning when it's way too late.  "I just hope people will recognize those signs sooner," says O'Donnell. Often people wait until things get so toxic or they are so demoralized that they get emotional. That's when people say hateful things and storm out. For the most part, quitting should not be a spur-of-the-moment decision. It might feel good in the moment, but leaving on bad terms only hurts you. Remember, you might need to ask people at your old job for a reference in order to get a new one. O'Donnell says there are other wrong ways to quit: Don't resign before you have a written offer; a verbal one might fall through. Don't quit to look for a job; that's just bad time management. Quitting on impulse leads to gaps on résumés that don't look good. Run toward a goal, not away from a bad job situation. The first step in preparing is defining what you're looking for, O'Donnell says. O'Donnell recognizes that having a plan works great, when things go to plan. But they don't always. There are situations that demand an immediate exit — such as workplace assault or sexual harassment, or when the stress is so high it's causing medical problems. Outside those instances, where you're physically unsafe, she says, most people can buy a little time to plan. The next is to have a financial plan, as well as health insurance. It took Anna Trujillo, a senior project manager for a bank in Salt Lake City, three years to get comfortable with the idea of leaving what was her first job. "I'd wake up in the morning and just sit at the bed and cry," says Trujillo, who says she loved her co-workers but felt overworked and was also taking care of her sick mother at the time. Only after her then-fiancé showed her some financial analysis that they'd be fine on savings for nine months did she feel comfortable quitting. Ideally, says O'Donnell, a plan would involve a year's worth of savings, because the average job search takes nine months. "People aren't as prepared for the job search to take as long or be as hard." Not everyone has banked a year's worth of a safety net — or they get forced out of a job before reaching that savings milestone. For them, O'Donnell recommends getting a side job, downsizing their life, selling off any excess items they can live without — all before being unemployed. Thinking through what you're going to say, how you're going to say it and whom you're going to tell first is a big part of leaving a job on good terms. O'Donnell says final impressions last. Also, assume you'll be working with some of your colleagues again in the future — because that happens all the time. Even if the job was horrible, think about the lessons learned and try to find a positive spin on things. Try saying something like, "This move is about me wanting a new challenge in my career." The exit interview is not a dumping ground for pent-up grievances. Remember, what you say will be documented and kept in your file. The first person to know about your pending departure should be your boss, regardless of your relationship with that person. The conversation should take place face-to-face or at a minimum over the phone — never over text or email. After you've told the boss and talked to human resources, then you can tell co-workers, but be sure to stick to the script — and don't talk about your new job on your outgoing employer's time. "Don't be pulled into gossip. Stay positive," O'Donnell says. One of the best things you can do to leave a good last impression is to make sure your old employer is not left in the lurch. If you can, offer to train your successor or negotiate a leave date that works for your old employer. Don't try to take clients with you, especially if you have a noncompete agreement in your employment contract. Employers have deeper pockets to sue ex-employees if they violate those terms, O'Donnell says. Beloved colleagues can often be the hardest to say goodbye to. But make sure to not just stay connected but to also proactively write public recommendations for your former co-workers on LinkedIn. Be specific about what they do well and what you liked about working with them. This will not only help them, but it will likely help you seal your own reputation as a great colleague.
The Popularity Of (And Problem With) Municipal Bonds,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/08/794648421/the-popularity-of-and-problem-with-municipal-bonds,January 8, 2020, Municipal bonds, or "munis," are having a moment. With interest rates at near-historic lows, investors are thirsty for yield. They're also keen to maximize any tax advantages that might be available to them, following recent changes to the tax code. Munis fit the bill in both cases, as riskier issuers come to market, with lower-rated and higher-yielding bonds.  This is great news for towns, cities and other municipal borrowers, who are able to fund their growth projects. But there are hidden risks for investors and for the wider economy. Marilyn Cohen of Envision Capital Management, Inc., joined us to walk through some of the pitfalls that the muni bond craze might bring.  Music by Drop Electric.

 President Trump delivers remarks at the beginning of a 2017 meeting with his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. Andrea Bernstein's new book, American Oligarchs, argues that both the Trump and Kushner families have benefited from the intersection of money and politics. Today President Trump is the face of the Republican Party, but as recently as 2011, Trump donated $5,000 to Democrat Kamala Harris' campaign to become California's attorney general. American Oligarchs author Andrea Bernstein says Trump's donation history is indicative of a practice he learned from his father, Fred Trump. Fred Trump amassed his real estate fortune in part, Bernstein says, by donating to politicians who would bend rules to his favor — and his son followed suit: "It is a lifelong practice for Fred Trump — and then later for Donald Trump — that they cultivate[d] their connections with the Brooklyn political machine, which at that time was almost exclusively controlled by the Democratic Party." "You would see [Donald Trump] continuing the practices that he learned from his father: making enormous political donations, hiring the lawyers and the insurance brokers and other people connected to the political machines, learning how to manipulate law enforcement," she says. Bernstein co-hosts the podcast Trump, Inc., which investigates who profits from the Trump administration. Her new book, American Oligarchs, examines how Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have benefited from family connections and the influence of money in politics. On Donald Trump's grandfather, Friedrich Trump, who emigrated from Germany in 1885 The Kushners, the Trumps, and the Marriage of Money and Power by Andrea Bernstein Hardcover, 368 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? He left Germany because of inheritance laws. He was not the oldest son, and he was only going to be able to inherit a small plot of land. Also, Germany was at war, and he didn't want to enter the army. So he came to America and got work immediately as a barber. He lived in New York City and decided he wanted to make more money. So he went west. ... It was ... the end of the gold rush era. And so people streamed northward. And it was an incredibly arduous passage to this territory in [what was] really Alaska then, or, I guess, northwest Canada. There was this dream of people going there. They had to carry 1,000 pounds of goods with them to make sure that they would make the trip. So it was a really hard trip, and they had to eat horse meat along the way, and there were driving mosquitoes. But when they got there, they were looking for gold. Now, Friedrich Trump was not doing that. He was in the hospitality business. He ran a series of restaurants known as the Arctic Restaurant. And they sold all kinds of food and liquor. The evidence suggests sex — that they were actually places where the men doing the mining could find female company. ... Not very many people made money from the gold rush, but Friedrich Trump managed to escape the gold rush with a lot of money and bring it back east, which is how they started the Trump family real estate business. On the involvement of Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, in the New York political machine  In the mid-1930s, [Fred Trump] goes into a Brooklyn courtroom with very little real estate experience ... buying, building houses and selling them one by one until he actually got out of the business because of the Depression. And he goes and he ... makes an argument for why he should get an assignment from a judge to take over a piece of a bankrupt company. But he realizes along the way that ... the judges are controlled by the Brooklyn political machine. And to get the judge's attention, he needs to become close to the Brooklyn political machine. ... So Fred Trump becomes one of the largest donors to the Democratic Party. He becomes very, very close to a Democratic political club called the Madison Club. And the way these clubs worked at the time was that they would get people out to the polls and they would sort of offer jobs to the people that were loyal. And they control everything. On the Trump family's business dependence on government help  They could not have been what they are without the help of the taxpayers in a whole variety of ways through infrastructure programs, through tax abatement programs, which allowed them to avoid paying taxes in certain instances. And they also benefited by what The New York Times called "outright fraud." They just simply didn't pay the taxes they were supposed to. So they were in this position of getting help from the government and getting help from government programs, at the same time actively trying not to pay money back to the taxpayers. On why the Trumps spread the myth that they're Swedish  There are a lot of outright falsehoods in the Trump family biography, and in what Trump says about himself, and in what his father said about himself. Fred Trump's father came from Germany and his mother came from Germany and they actually spoke German at home. And he, during the war, was building — in Virginia — federally subsidized housing. And he didn't want people to know of his German roots, so he said he was Swedish. And this became a theme constantly that Fred Trump — and then later, Donald Trump — said their roots were Swedish. And they said it constantly. The most interesting time they said it was at Fred Trump's funeral. The New York Post reported Fred Trump was from Sweden. That lie traveled with him until the end of his life. And in many of the early profiles of Donald Trump, for example, in The New York Times, they kept saying his ancestors are Swedish. And it was repeated over and over again. But Donald Trump's grandfather and grandmother were definitely from Germany. It was clear where his grandparents were from. But it became a family myth, because it was better business to be Swedish than it was to be German during the war. And Donald Trump seems to have attached to the glamour of Swedish [people]. He refers in his own book on several occasions to Swedish models. So it's something that he seems to view as aspirational, as a good place to be from. You might remember when he made his comments about countries giving us immigrants, he said, why can't we get people from Norway? So he seems to have a fixation on Scandinavia as being a desirable place to be from. On Jared Kushner's grandmother's Holocaust survival story  The Kushner family was sent to die, to board trucks bound for mass graves. But then, before they could board the trucks, they were asked, "Is anybody here a furrier?" And the Kushners said they were, and the Germans pulled them out of the line because they wanted them to make hats and coats for the German army. And this is what they did. They basically lived inside a ghetto, had very little to eat and had to work as enslaved people for the Nazis, and the Nazis kept killing more and more people as they decided they were superfluous. There were a few hundred survivors in the summer of 1943, and they realized they had to escape. They knew that there was a band of partisan Jews in the forest. And if they could get out there, they had a chance of living. So they began to dig a tunnel, and they had to hide the bags of dirt that they were excavating underneath beds and inside walls so the Nazis wouldn't find them. But they did build this tunnel and crawled out of it. It was 2 feet across. [Jared's grandmother] Rae Kushner and her father, Naum Kushner, and her sister, Lisa, made it out of the tunnel alive and into the forest. Their brother Chanon, when he got out of the tunnel, became disoriented, ran in the wrong direction and was ultimately shot by the Nazis. On why Bernstein thinks there has been so little accountability for Donald Trump's actions  One of the things that the Trump family has always understood is that part of their business success needs to be making sure that no law enforcement agent or district attorney or prosecutor is going to blow the whistle. ... He has managed through money and charm to keep law enforcement at bay, and he has never been called to account. And what we find is that each time he is not called to account, he feels more powerful to go even further the next time. We see this exact pattern with Ukraine. [The] Mueller report does not lead to an impeachment. The day after Mueller testifies, [Trump] calls the president of Ukraine and asks him to interfere in the 2020 election. So what is at balance in this upcoming impeachment trial? This is the final way to call Donald Trump to account. If he is not called to account, I think we can only expect what we've seen in the past, which is that he feels even more empowered to break rules, break norms in the way he's been doing.

 Former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn addresses a news conference Wednesday in Beirut, during which he explained his reasons for dodging trial in Japan. The 65-year-old former auto executive, who is accused of financial misconduct, vowed to clear his name in his first public appearance since skipping bail in Japan. Carlos Ghosn is on the lam, sure, but the former Nissan boss still has a lot to say. This made for a peculiar affair Wednesday when Ghosn broke his public silence at a marathon news conference in Beirut. Standing behind a lectern and gesturing occasionally before a prepared PowerPoint presentation, Ghosn struck a defiant tone after fleeing house arrest in Japan and escaping to the Lebanese capital late last month. "There was no way I was going to be treated fairly," the 65-year-old said. "No sign that I was going to have a normal life for the next four or five years. So I can tell you that, I mean, it's not very difficult to come to [the] conclusion that you're going to die in Japan, or you're going to have to get out." The longtime Nissan executive has been credited with reviving the brand and orchestrating a successful "alliance" with other major automakers around the world — including France's Renault and Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Motors, both of which he has helmed in various capacities. But that towering position quickly collapsed in November 2018, when Nissan ousted him amid allegations of financial impropriety. Less than a month later, Japanese authorities formally indicted Ghosn on charges that he underreported his personal earnings — charges that eventually ballooned to include the misappropriation of Nissan funds and a breach of trust. After several months behind bars, Ghosn was released on bail in March 2019. Last month, despite close surveillance and an order to surrender his passports, the Brazilian-born executive mounted a shocking — and still rather mysterious — escape from Japan to Beirut, where he spent much of his youth. Once auto industry royalty, Ghosn is now the subject of a wanted notice by Interpol. Lebanese authorities, who have no extradition agreement with Japan, have suggested they plan to interrogate Ghosn but have committed to nothing further. Ghosn, meanwhile, declined to go into details about his escape during Wednesday's news conference — but he remained steadfast in his position that, despite appearances, he does not consider himself a fugitive from the law. "It is important for me to emphasize that I'm not above the law. And I welcome the opportunity for the truth to come out and to have my name vindicated and my reputation restored. I did not escape justice. I fled injustice and persecution," he told journalists. "Having endured more than 400 days of inhumane treatment in a system designed to break me and unwilling to provide me even minimal justice, I was left with no other choice but to protect myself and my family," he said, adding: "The truth is that justice [is] irrelevant to these individuals. This was the most difficult decision of my life." 
                Carlos Ghosn's marathon news conference Wednesday spanned a remarkable range of topics and emotions, as evident from this triptych of images captured during the event.

 Ghosn pointed to Japan's remarkably high conviction rate, which stands at more than 99% after indictment, to make the point that he would not have received a fair and speedy trial. And he is not the first to make this point, as his detention has elicited widespread conversation about Japan's criminal justice system.  Some explain the eye-popping rate as the result of the extraordinary powers ascribed to prosecutors — including the right to subject suspects to marathon interrogations without lawyers present — while others assert it's more likely because prosecutors are highly selective in choosing their cases. Whatever the cause may be, Ghosn also said his lawyers had warned him he might have had to wait five years for a final judgment in Japan. "I have spent the previous months being interrogated for up to eight hours a day without any lawyers present, without an understanding of what exactly I was being accused of, without access to the evidence that justified this travesty against my human rights and dignity," he said. " 'It will get worse for you if you don't just confess,' the prosecutor told me repeatedly." The Tokyo prosecutors office pushed back on this assertion in a statement issued after Ghosn's roughly 2 1/2-hour news conference ended. "Defendant Ghosn's allegations completely ignore his own conduct," it notes, "and his one-sided criticism of the Japanese criminal justice system is totally unacceptable." One day earlier, with the executive's planned news conference looming, prosecutors also obtained an arrest warrant for Ghosn's wife, Carole, for allegedly committing perjury last year. She, too, was on hand in Beirut on Wednesday, watching the news conference amid the throng of journalists.

 From left: Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Music Group; artist Billie Eilish; and Eilish's brother, songwriter Finneas O'Connell — photographed during the 2019 American Music Awards at Microsoft Theater on Nov. 24, 2019 in Los Angeles. The past few years have seen a wealth of international talent breaking through to the mainstream, with artists from countries like South Korea, Nigeria, Colombia and Australia having climbed to the top of the charts.  One country that's been missing from the party: China. Though home to about 20% of the world's population, and despite every major label and concert promoter maintaining an office there, virtually no Chinese acts have broken into the mainstream at the same level as other regional-turned-global genres, like K-pop and música urbana. (There are several potential reasons for this gap — from perceived language barriers, to metadata and payment challenges for artists and songwriters, to Chinese regulations with murky criteria around what constitutes acceptable content.) But that doesn't mean China is absent from the business of music. Quite the opposite: While the country may not be churning out global hits, its tech conglomerates are financially participating in the global operations that make those hits possible. On New Year's Eve 2019, it was announced that Chinese tech behemoth Tencent Holdings would lead a consortium of investors to purchase a collective 10% stake in Universal Music, the world's dominant record label group and the parent company to Capitol Records, Blue Note and Republic, among many others. Vivendi, parent company of Universal Music, first announced its intentions to offload a portion of the company in 2018. (The deal has yet to be approved — Vivendi, parent company to Universal Music, expects it to be finalized within the first half of 2020.) Tencent Holdings owns China's biggest music company, Tencent Music Entertainment, which controls roughly 60% to 70% of the local music market and itself owns shares in many high-profile global music ventures. In fact, just over two years ago, Tencent Music and Spotify announced an unusual equity-swap agreement, in which the two companies purchased a roughly 9% stake in each other's businesses. (While Spotify is available in nearly 80 markets, China is not currently one of them.) Tencent Music also operates the Chinese music-streaming apps QQ Music, Kugou and Kuwo, as well as karaoke app WeSing. According to the company's latest earnings report, its three music-streaming products attracted over 661 million mobile monthly active users in the third quarter of 2019. Only around 5% of those users paid for a subscription, yet the company is still profitable, because it makes over 70% of its revenue from "social entertainment services" such as tipping and other forms of in-app "virtual gifts" — which are commonplace on Chinese social-media platforms, though rare in the Western streaming landscape. (Legally and literally speaking, it's somewhat insufficient to refer to Tencent Music as simply a "Chinese" company, because it's incorporated in the Cayman Islands, just like its parent company, and trades publicly on the New York Stock Exchange.)  Tencent's emergence as one of the most powerful players in music brings new clarity to the exact nature of the industry's globalization. But why would Tencent want to diversify into the label business? It certainly has a large-enough audience, to the tune of hundreds of millions of monthly active users, as well as more than enough cash to keep afloat.  The most likely answer is direct access to intellectual property and talent — combining music creation, marketing, distribution and consumption into one business. Tencent Music may have the technological prowess to maintain its apps, but needs a bit more help when it comes to artist marketing and creative development. That's where Universal Music comes in. To clarify, Tencent's equity stake in Universal does not mean that the former owns any of the latter's copyrights — it simply means that Tencent gets to share in a part of Universal's future financial growth, which certainly does correlate to the rising value of the label's catalog, spanning artists from Billie Eilish to J Balvin and Queen. Importantly, this contradicts one of the most widespread music-tech narratives of the past five years, that streaming companies want to decrease their reliance on major labels (and vice versa) in order to improve their bottom lines. In a world where no one can quite agree on whether content or tech is king, streaming services and music rights-owners are actually more tethered to each other than ever — and Tencent's deals with Universal and Spotify arguably put paid to the possibility of independence for any of these stakeholders. To wit: Tencent Holdings, Tencent Music and other investors own a 10% stake in Universal Music Group, while Tencent Music and Spotify own around a 9% stake in each other. But let's not forget that the two other major labels, Sony Music and Warner Music, also collectively own around a 4% stake in Tencent Music. And Universal Music and Sony Music also own stakes in Spotify, around 3% to 4% each.

 What complicates this web even more is that Tencent Music has the exclusive right to broker licensing deals for the catalogs of all three major labels (Universal, Warner and Sony) in China, which effectively gives it oversight of the domestic music market by sublicensing these vast catalogs to its competitors — like Alibaba, NetEase, ByteDance and Baidu. To better understand this situation, imagine a world where Spotify had the exclusive right to distribute all the major labels' catalog in the U.S. In this world, if Apple Music or Amazon Music wanted to feature, say, Billie Eilish's catalog on their platforms, they would have to go to Spotify, not Billie's label (Universal-owned Interscope Records), to legally offer their customers her songs. This scenario would probably be short-lived, thanks to antitrust protections. Indeed, federal antitrust authorities in China are currently investigating Tencent Music's exclusive deals with the majors — though some argue that those arrangements have allowed Tencent Music to play a proactive, impactful role in helping to curb piracy in the country and grow the local music economy overall. Moreover, to revisit the fact that Spotify is not available in China: It's practically impossible for any company to establish an online presence in the country without getting some sort of approval from the national government's censorship arm, which includes but is not limited to obtaining an Internet Content Provider (ICP) license. This further strengthens Tencent's leverage, and weeds out most international competition. (Disney and Netflix faced similar challenges with their respective streaming services last year; the latter has opted to license their own content to Chinese-owned platforms, instead of launching in the country directly.) With the largest paid-subscriber base, Spotify understandably dominates much of the global industry conversation about music streaming. But the rise of Tencent underscores how Spotify is actually the exception, not the rule, when it comes to streaming's future. Spotify is what industry insiders call a "pure-play" streaming service — i.e., one that makes its money purely from music and audio consumption, probably via advertising or monthly subscriptions. Other examples of pure-play services include Pandora, Tidal and Deezer, none of which are even close to having Spotify's global reach and user numbers. Even Spotify itself faces financial challenges in its overreliance on licensing music from third parties, having been profitable for only two quarters out of its entire 12-year existence. In contrast, non-pure-play streaming platforms — like Apple Music, Amazon Music and Google-owned YouTube — have the safety net of multibillion-dollar tech corporations behind them. Such services don't have as much of a pressure to turn a profit, and in fact exist primarily to increase sales in their parent companies' core businesses (e.g. Apple Music drives loyalty to iPhones; Amazon Music drives sales of Amazon Prime and smart speakers; YouTube drives Google's ad revenue). For Tencent, like its stateside peers, music is just a drop in the bucket, one amongst its hundreds of other businesses and investments. Aside from controlling most of China's music market, Tencent Holdings also owns WeChat and QQ, two of China's biggest social and messaging platforms. Its gaming subsidiary, Tencent Games, owns Riot Games (League of Legends) and has stakes in Epic Games (Fortnite), Ubisoft (Assassin's Creed) and Activision Blizzard (Call of Duty). All in all, the conglomerate invested in a total of "only" 108 companies across media, entertainment, fintech and education in 2019, which was actually a 33% drop in activity year-over-year. Music is just one of many layers atop this sprawling ecosystem. Tencent Holdings' diversification has given Tencent Music the wiggle room to pull off what Spotify has yet to accomplish, at least on the music side: profiting from both a digital audience and the talent entertaining it. (In fact, long before its Universal Music deal, Tencent Music launched its own joint-venture record label with Sony Music called Liquid State, which promotes electronic artists from across the Asian diaspora.) Owning a part of Universal Music and Spotify could potentially enable Tencent to expand this vertical-integration philosophy beyond its own domestic apps, and establish a large footprint in Western markets. And if the music industry in 2020 is inseparable from Chinese money, it's only a matter of time before Chinese talent follows suit.

 Stickers designed by Grebet depict a local musician (left), and a woman wearing a traditional head scarf. O'Plerou Grebet is a 22-year-old graphic design student in Ivory Coast. Everywhere he looks, he sees signs of Western influence — from the glass skyscrapers and malls lining the streets in his home city of Abidjan to the way his peers spoke and dressed. "We are living like we're Western people," he says. "It's like we are not proud of our own culture." That even applies to the symbols he texts to friends using the messaging apps on his phone (they especially love to use the "tears of joy" face emoji, he says). So he used his design skills to create digital stickers that depict what he thinks is missing from global keyboard culture: symbols of history and daily life in Ivory Coast and neighboring countries.  #Zouzoukwa N°290 : Henné/Djabi des jeunes mariées A post shared by  O'Plérou Grebet (@creativorian) on Oct 17, 2018 at 12:43pm PDT In 2018, he released a free pack of over 360 stickers in a mobile app called "Zouzoukwa," which means "image" in the local Bété language. Available on Android and iPhone, it now has over 120,000 downloads. People can use the stickers on their phones like emoji. The icons reflect life and culture in Ivory Coast and the surrounding region. They include traditional masks, African instruments like the djembe drum (a goblet-shaped hand drum) and people clad in a variety of prints, fabrics and clothing that reflect regional heritage. There are also everyday objects: cans of soda, cubes of bouillon (a key ingredient in many African dishes) and popular types of chips and candy.  #zzkPaquinou N°9 : Goli ~ "Paquinou est la fête de la viande et du vin.

There's a woman with lips pursed, giving some serious side-eye — a sign of annoyance that's common in Ivory Coast but also translates across cultures. There's a guy with his index finger pulling down his bottom eyelid — it means "I told you so" in Ivory Coast, Grebet says.  #Zouzoukwa N°78: Tu as vu non / Je t’avais dit oh / Hum / Tu vas voir A post shared by  O'Plérou Grebet (@creativorian) on Mar 19, 2018 at 2:18pm PDT "They are expressions we often use in real life, but they were not represented in our phones," Grebet says. A next step, Grebet says, is to try and get some of his designs into the official emoji set, where they'd reach more than 2 billion people worldwide, as standardized symbols on smartphones everywhere.

She's consulted with Grebet about putting up a few of his designs for candidacy. She thinks foufou, a starchy paste made with mashed plantains, is particularly promising because it's a staple of many African cuisines. "What rice and bread and noodles are to certain parts of the world, foufou is to certain parts of Africa," she says. In the meantime, Grebet has submitted the "I told you so" expression to the Unicode committee. Lee says emoji is a common language for today's global youth.  "We always talk about representation the big screen," she says. "Representation on the small screen is also really important because it tells you what exists and what is important in the world."  Seeing icons for a hijab, an arepa, or an interracial couple, she says, establishes these realities as norms in the world. Grebet plans to keep traveling and expanding his experiences — and his sticker pack. His designs so far are drawn from his experience and research into a few African countries.  "I would like to travel to other countries and discover their cultures," he says, "and make emojis, and add them to the app."

 Jozef Dudek was 2 when he was killed by an Ikea dresser that fell on top of him at his family's home in California. Ikea has agreed to pay $46 million to a California family whose 2-year-old son, Jozef Dudek, was killed when an unsecured Ikea dresser fell on top of him. The family's lawyers say the dresser model was "inherently unstable." At least eight children are believed to have been killed by dressers that the Swedish furniture giant has recalled, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Daniel Mann, a lawyer for the Dudek family, said that millions of the recalled dressers may still be in use. The recalled dressers pose a risk of tipping over if they are not secured to the wall. Ikea has previously said that the products were not designed to be free-standing. Joleen and Craig Dudek, Jozef's parents, say that they are "telling our story because we do not want this to happen to another family." 
                Ikea recalled the three-drawer Malm dresser and other styles in 2016.

 The family is donating $1 million of the settlement money to organizations that advocate to protect kids from unsafe products. According to Mann, Ikea has also committed to broaden its outreach to consumers about the recalled dressers. Mann said he wants to see the company email consumers who purchased the hazardous dressers to warn them of the risks. An Ikea spokesperson confirmed the amount of the settlement with the Dudek family, which was agreed upon in late December. "While no settlement can alter the tragic events that brought us here, for the sake of the family and all involved, we're grateful that this litigation has reached a resolution," the company spokesperson said. "We remain committed to working proactively and collaboratively to address this very important home safety issue." The deadly incident happened after Jozef's father put him down for a nap in May 2017. "He must have gotten up at some point and went over to an Ikea three-drawer Malm dresser that was in his room and pulled the dresser onto him," Mann said. "His father came in and found him with his head in between the middle drawer and the top drawer. And Jozef was asphyxiated to death." The Dudeks had purchased the dresser in 2008 and never received notice that it had been recalled, according to Mann. The family filed the wrongful death lawsuit in 2018 in a Philadelphia court. They accused the company of failing to adequately warn consumers that the dresser could be dangerous, despite knowing the risks. The plaintiffs said that Ikea "intentionally, willfully, wantonly and recklessly failed to adequately redesign the MALM dresser line to address the known risk of injury and death, failed to cease sale of the MALM line, failed to warn the public of the known risk of injury and death and failed to institute a voluntary recall of the MALM line until after a number of children lost their lives." Mann's law firm, Feldman Shepherd Wohlgelernter Tanner Weinstock Dodig LLP, has also represented the families of three other toddlers who died as a result of Malm dresser tip-overs. In 2016, Ikea settled the cases filed by the families of Curren Collas, Camden Ellis and Ted McGee for a total of $50 million. As NPR has reported, after Curren and Camden died in 2014, Ikea started to offer free wall-mounting kits to customers. It encouraged them to secure their dressers to the wall to try to prevent children from tipping them over. A group of consumer safety groups criticized Ikea at the time for encouraging wall mounting rather than urging owners to return the dressers, as NPR reported. The groups, which included the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Consumer Federation of America, said, "Anchoring devices are meant as a second layer of protection for stable dressers — not as a replacement for making stable dressers in the first place." After Ted's death in 2016, the company recalled an estimated 17 million dressers from Malm and several other lines. Mann said that when Ikea initially released the dresser line, it did not participate in voluntary tip-over testing from a furniture industry trade group that he said is standard for the "vast majority" of U.S. furniture manufacturers. "There are a number of things that manufacturers can do to make dressers safer," said Mann. He said it's not just a function of how heavy a dresser is — it's also how the weight is distributed. To make a dresser more tip resistant, manufacturers can do things such as making the base drawer as deep as possible and putting more weight at the bottom than the top. After Ikea recalled the Malm dressers, it eventually redesigned them. The new product is "marginally better" than the old one, Mann said.

Nobel Prize winners brushed shoulders with former chairs of the Federal Reserve in a sea of anxious grad students hoping to land jobs. Planet Money was there too. The conference has become a ritual. Long lines for coffee. No WiFi. Econ jargon echoing through the halls. And, in recent years, a profession grappling with the fact that it's disproportionately white and male. Last year, the Planet Money newsletter covered a panel session called "How Can Economics Solve Its Gender Problem?" It featured an all-star cast of female economists who reckoned with a field they described as rife with sexism, misogyny, and bullying.  The awkward irony of that panel was its participants were virtually all white. That led to complaints on Twitter, which laid the groundwork for this year's follow-up panel: "How Can Economics Solve Its Race Problem?" Janet Yellen, the former chairwoman of the Federal Reserve and the incoming president of the American Economic Association (AEA), kicked off the discussion by citing abysmal statistics on diversity in the field and declaring that the organization "places very high priority on finding ways to address the problem of minority underrepresentation."  Last year, the AEA conducted a climate survey of over 10,000 members, finding minority economists are deeply unhappy with the state of the profession. "Along all dimensions of discrimination examined in the survey, Asians, African Americans, and Latinx economists report having substantially worse experiences than their white counterparts," Yellen said. "Practices and patterns of behavior that are widespread in the profession are harming the progress of minorities."  The panelists, who were all minorities, shared stories of discrimination, harassment, and belittlement they have faced over their careers. Trevon Logan, a black economist at Ohio State University, shared a story about the first time he came to the annual meeting. He was finishing grad school and was there to interview for faculty jobs. "And someone, who later became an editor of articles I published, called me 'boy.'" The crowd gasped. Cecilia Conrad, an executive at the MacArthur Foundation and a former professor and dean at Pomona College, recalled "my first year teaching, when three white male students complained about being taught by an 'obvious Affirmative Action hire.'" The panelists also shared stories of well-meaning colleagues and students who nonetheless exhibited unconscious biases that made their lives tougher.  Despite knowledge of minority underrepresentation in economics for many decades, the field has failed to see much improvement. For over fifty years, the AEA's Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession (CSMGEP) has monitored racial progress in the field. CSMGEP co-chair Ebonya Washington, an economist at Yale University who moderated the panel, told us about their latest annual report. "If you go back to the beginning of the millennium, there's been no progress since then," Washington said. "In fact, for blacks, they're now a smaller percentage of economics PhDs than there was in 2000."  Solving The Problem The panelists offered many culprits for the race problem in economics, including poor leadership, institutional dysfunctions, discouragement from specializing in the study of race, and a toxic professional culture.  A few weeks ago, we interviewed Esther Duflo, who just became the first female economist to win the Nobel Prize. (The only other woman to win it, Elinor Ostrom, was a political scientist.) She also blamed an "aggressive and macho" culture for the problem of underrepresentation. But she also pointed her finger to what she believes is a widespread misunderstanding on what economics actually is. People, she said, "have a misconception that economics only deals with interest rates and growth rates and finance and stuff like that."  We asked the panelists whether they believed that general misperceptions of economics discouraged minorities from studying it and whether reforming Econ 101 might be part of the solution. All agreed.  "People kinda equate economics with business, so they kinda think if you study economics you're trying to game the system or make it in the system," said Edward Miguel, an economist at UC Berkeley. "But I think we see economics as a tool to change the system." Miguel said he didn't believe that many Econ 101 courses, which are often taught by teachers with a "strong free-market ideology," give students this view of the discipline. That, he suggested, might disproportionately dissuade underrepresented groups from pursuing economics further. "So reforming Econ 101 could be a small, but important part of solving the pipeline problem."  Amanda Bayer, an economist at Swarthmore college, recently conducted a field experiment with 2,710 students across nine colleges to see what happens when economics is communicated differently. They randomly sent two different types of emails to incoming female and minority freshman. One email was just a standard welcome message. The other included information "showcasing the diversity of research and researchers within economics." They then tested the impact of these messages by comparing them to a statistically identical group that did not receive them.  Bayer and her colleagues found that female and minority students who received the email advertising economics' diversity saw a 20 percent increase in their course completion rate. It's a pretty big improvement from such a small intervention.  On the second day of the conference, Bayer, who is leading an AEA task force aimed at making economics more inclusive and diverse, chaired a panel that provided an overview of such research to improve the profession. The task force recently published a report that provides economic departments with a list of best practices.  Former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, the outgoing president of the AEA, commissioned this task force and spoke on the panel about his efforts over the last year to implement reforms. In addition to protecting existing members, Bernanke stressed the need to attract talented young scholars from all backgrounds. "Having a broader, more diverse profession gives a better profession in terms of what we study, how we study, and how smart we are," Bernanke said. Did you enjoy this newsletter?

 Lovot companion robots by Groove X wander at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Flying cars, big-screen TVs that rotate vertically to better show your mobile videos, a trash can that changes its own bag: Welcome to CES. About 200,000 people will descend on Las Vegas this week to check it all out at the annual technology extravaganza of the Consumer Electronics Show. Among the robots they will encounter is the Charmin RollBot. That's roll as in a roll of toilet paper, which is what the small-wheel robot carries on top of itself. "So you're on the commode, you look over, oh no, somebody didn't change the roll. Hello? Nobody home," explained Gregg Weaver, who works in research and development at Procter & Gamble, Charmin's parent company.  That's when you take out your smartphone and summon the RollBot via Bluetooth. It "delivers a fresh roll of Charmin, saves the day," Weaver says. That might sound a bit dramatic, but this single-task robot could save you a few uncomfortable steps to retrieve a spare roll. 
                The Bluetooth-enabled Charmin RollBot is on display at CES in Las Vegas. The robot is just a concept — it isn't available to buy — but it would deliver a roll of toilet paper in the user's home.

 The Bluetooth-enabled Charmin RollBot is on display at CES in Las Vegas. The robot is just a concept — it isn't available to buy — but it would deliver a roll of toilet paper in the user's home. You can't buy P&G's robot — or a lot of the stuff on display here. But that's what much of CES is about: glimpsing at the future of technology. Things like touch screens and voice assistants showed up here years before they became mainstream. The show is a dizzying display of tech in every form imaginable, spread over almost 3 million square feet of exhibition space. Visitors must dodge rolling robots and people stumbling around, their eyes covered by virtual reality headsets. A lot of the buzz at this year's show is about 5G — the next generation of much faster cellular networks. It promises to be up to 100 times faster than current networks, said Kevin Westcott, a vice chairman at consulting firm Deloitte. 5G is still in the early stages, but that's not dampening the excitement. "It doesn't mean a huge amount today, because can I download a movie faster or do I get my traffic updates faster? That's not going to change my life," Westcott said. "What's going to change it is when people start envisioning new applications that use absolutely real-time data." Thanks to 5G, self-driving cars will be able to communicate with each other — and to the roads they are driving on. Among the companies at CES working on this is Valerann, a British-Israeli startup that puts sensors in roads. The sensors detect traffic and weather, and can light up to direct cars around a vehicle pulled over onto the shoulder. Shahar Bahiri, a co-founder of Valerann, says the company is already using 5G connections in some places because it's the fastest way to share data. "When you know that you have this stopped vehicle, when you know that you have black ice on the road," he said, "your life is easier using data." But CES is not all robots and futuristic cars. Health is also a big theme here, and many of the startups at this year's show are making apps and devices that bring the tools of the doctor's office to your smartphone. At another booth, a company called Binah uses an iPad's camera to read a person's vital signs by scanning her face. It looks for a tiny movement in the skin under the eye each time the heart beats. "There's a change in the reflection of the light on your skin," said Mona Popilian, Binah's director of marketing. "And we say OK, now there's been a heartbeat, and then there's another and another. And so we have the heart rate. And based on this, we continue to calculate the rest of the measurements," she said. That includes oxygen levels, respiration rate and mental stress. Binah plans to add blood pressure measurements this year. It's useful not just for individuals. Popilian says Binah's app can be used by doctors to remotely examine patients. A big Japanese insurance company is using it to monitor drivers' stress levels. Popilian invites me to try out the app, so I step in front of the iPad and she starts the scan. It takes a few seconds to deliver my results. My heart rate and oxygen levels are normal — but, after dodging robots and surrounded by flashing screens, unsurprisingly, I am mildly stressed.

 Pantone's color of the year for 2020: Classic Blue. How much does color matter when you're buying something? According to the Pantone Color Institute, a whole lot. Each year since 2000, Pantone has announced a Color Of The Year, driving many businesses' marketing decisions. For 2020, that color is...Classic Blue. To The Indicator team, it kind of looked like our bank cards, standard and unremarkable.  This is in striking contrast to recent years, when Pantone has chosen more vibrant colors: Living Coral, Ultra Violet, Greenery. So, why Classic Blue? What does this say about the time we're living in, and how can we expect businesses to respond?  Music by Drop Electric and Audio UX. Find us: Twitter / Facebook / Newsletter.

Investor's Naked Selfies Ignite #MeToo Moment: Female Founder Fights Back,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/06/793134459/investors-naked-selfie-ignites-metoo-moment-female-founder-fights-back,January 6, 2020,

 Elizabeth Giorgi created the "candor clause" after being harassed by a would-be investor. "I've probably spoken to more than 100 female founders across the U.S., and I would say that half of us have a story," she says. The experience of raising money last year bewildered Elizabeth Giorgi at first. Almost always, she pitched her startup company, Soona, to an all-male audience of investors. "People would assume that my male colleague was the founder and not me," she says. "I would occasionally have people ask me about whether or not I have children or if I was planning on having children anytime soon." There were few women Giorgi could turn to. Many young companies look to venture capital investments to fund their early years, but that's an industry dominated by men. According to All Raise, a group advocating for women in business, 85% of partners at venture capital firms are men, and a large majority — 71% — have no female partner at all. And the industry has had its share of #MeToo problems — as Giorgi says she soon personally experienced. Last February, she found an investor who seemed keen on her vision to expand Soona, a same-day photo and video startup she co-founded. He agreed to invest. Then later that evening, she says, he sent her naked photos of himself. "I remember crying in the bedroom upstairs while my colleagues were having dinner downstairs because I just thought, 'Is this what I'm going to have to subject myself to if I want to raise this money and build our dream?' " she says. Giorgi turned down his money and blocked all contacts with him. But the experience reverberated. "I've probably spoken to more than 100 female founders across the U.S., and I would say that half of us have a story," she says. So Giorgi asked her lawyers to draw up what she calls the "candor clause." It requires investors in her company to disclose any prior allegations of discrimination or sexual harassment. Giorgi says that because investors wield an enormous amount of influence over startups and their executives, it's critical to address potentially toxic personal dynamics upfront. "If nothing else, we should be able to have radically honest conversations with each other about how we want to be treated in the world," she says. So far, Giorgi has secured $1.5 million in funding from investors, including 2048 Ventures, Matchstick Ventures and Techstars Ventures, all of which endorsed her candor clause and included it in the language of their contracts with her company. She has since shared it publicly on her company's website, hoping to help other women founders, who are a relatively rare breed. Last year, only 2.6% of all venture capital funds in the U.S. went to firms founded by women, according to All Raise and research firm PitchBook.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Other surveys find that sexual harassment is a big problem for female founders. Ellen Pao is a former venture capital investor who sued premier Silicon Valley investment firm Kleiner Perkins for gender discrimination. She lost at trial in 2015 and now heads Project Include, which advocates for diversity in technology. Pao applauds the candor clause and its intent but says if it's violated and the case goes to court, women would still face an uphill battle. "It's so hard to sue venture capital firms," she says. "Having done it myself, they have so many resources." Indeed, meeting the legal standard for sexual harassment is difficult in court, which is one reason that the candor clause and other similar efforts aim to prevent problems before they occur. Take an online directory called #MovingForward, which publishes discrimination and harassment policies of venture capital firms that agree to post them. The list is the brainchild of serial entrepreneur Cheryl Yeoh Sew Hoy, who says she was sexually harassed and assaulted by an investor five years ago. "When I was harassed, I didn't know what to do," she says. "There's a problem between VC-founder relationships and a power imbalance. What can we do at the very basic level to improve that?"  About 150 firms worldwide have posted their policies on #MovingForward so far. Sew Hoy calls it slow but meaningful progress. Giorgi says 40 women founders have gotten their investors to sign the candor clause, but others are afraid to push for it. "I have had conversations with other female founders who've expressed fear about trying to talk about the candor clause and concerns that it would somehow cause an investor to rescind their support," Giorgi says. "Don't think so little of yourself," Giorgi says she counsels them. "You have a right to demand better behavior."

 An Indian taxi driver drives his Premier Padmini past the iconic building Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station in Mumbai, India. At the edge of a tree-lined lane in Mumbai, India, Abdul Kareem opens the hood of his taxi and pours water into the radiator. The car is black with a yellow roof, like all Mumbai cabs. But it stands out in a line of cars. It's antique-looking and kind of boxy, with bulbous headlights. It has a metal luggage rack on its roof that proclaims "Mumbai" in bright orange lettering. On the streets, Kareem says, people point out the taxi to their kids.   A generation ago, India's financial capital Bombay became Mumbai. Its cotton mills were redeveloped into swanky malls and offices. Hipster bars replaced the city's historical Irani cafes. Now another Mumbai icon is riding off into the sunset: the vintage black and yellow taxi.  
                Abdul Kareem sits behind the wheel of his Premier Padmini taxi — which will go off Mumbai's streets by the summer.

 Abdul Kareem sits behind the wheel of his Premier Padmini taxi — which will go off Mumbai's streets by the summer. The car — an Indian version of the Italian model Fiat 1100 — made a debut on India's streets in the 1960s. It was manufactured in India by a local company, Premier Automobiles Ltd. The car was named Premier Padmini, after a legendary Indian royal. Early posters advertise the car as "a beautiful princess of your own," with a picture of an Indian woman decked in gold jewelry. In the 1980s and 1990s, Premier Padmini became synonymous with Mumbai taxis. In its heyday, some 60,000 Padmini taxis plied the city's streets, according to Anthony Lawrence Quadros, general secretary of the Mumbai taxi drivers' union.  "It's an iconic car which has served millions of people," Quadros says. In 1991, when India's government passed reforms allowing more private competition in the economy, global companies started flooding the Indian market. The Padmini, which hadn't had an update in years, had to compete with modern, foreign cars equipped with the latest technology. Premier Automobiles suffered huge losses and stopped production in 2000.  
                Cabbie Abdul Kareem poses with his Premier Padmini taxi — one of only about 50 that were still on Mumbai's streets as of December. Once ubiquitous, the Padmini is being replaced by modern cars.

 Cabbie Abdul Kareem poses with his Premier Padmini taxi — one of only about 50 that were still on Mumbai's streets as of December. Once ubiquitous, the Padmini is being replaced by modern cars. Then, in 2008, the government of the state of Maharashtra, whose capital is Mumbai, started to phase out older cars to reduce pollution. They banned all taxis that were older than 25 years. In 2013, they revised the rule and made the age limit 20. A lot of taxi drivers and owners became unemployed, says Quadros. Some had taken out loans for their vehicles and their lives were ruined, he says. Thousands of Padmini taxis suddenly vanished from Mumbai's streets. Sixty-year-old Ram Vilas Maurya's cab was one of them. "I miss Padmini," Maurya says. "She was a tough car." The modern car he now drives gets a dent even at the slightest collision, he says. Padmini wasn't like that, he adds.  Maurya smiles as he reminisces about his Padmini, which was also his first vehicle when he started driving taxis in Mumbai some 30 years ago. "I used to take my kids to the beach on weekends in that car," he says. This year, even the youngest Padminis will have to go. It's already very hard to spot one. Only about 50 were left as of December, according to Quadros. And Mumbai residents have started noticing their absence. "When you're trying to get to the airport and you have all these suitcases, you realize the new taxis that run on compressed natural gas have cylinders in the back and there's not a lot of space," says 37-year-old Rachel Lopez, a lifelong Mumbai resident. The Padmini, on the contrary, had a huge trunk space as well as an overhead carrier. What else was different about riding in a Padmini cab? For one, Lopez says, you needed good upper-body strength to travel. "They wouldn't close with a polite little click," she says. "You had to really kind of bash them in and then you hear a metallic thud and you knew the door had closed." Even though she misses them, Lopez says she's not sad to see the Padminis go. They deserve a little rest now, she says. It also symbolizes how Mumbai operates. "Something old has to go to make room for something new," says Lopez. But before it disappears, it needs to be chronicled, says Lopez. A few years ago, she took it upon herself to document one classic feature of Mumbai's taxis: their funky, vibrant ceilings. Her Instagram page @thegreaterbombay has hundreds of photos of weird designs and patterns that adorn Mumbai's black-yellow taxi ceilings.  Celebration time on my #mumbaitaxi #ceiling. It's December.

Finnish photographer Markku Lahdesmaki is one of them. In the spring of 2011, when Lahdesmaki came to Mumbai for work, the scene that greeted him outside the airport surprised him.  "I saw these hundreds of very cool looking vintage taxi cars and I was like, wow," Lahdesmaki says. Over the next three days, he traveled across the city to take pictures of these cabs in interesting scenarios. What struck him the most, he says, was that all the cabbies were very proud of their taxis.  "When I was riding in this Padmini taxi, I felt like I was in a movie," says Lahdesmaki.  Some of Lahdesmaki's photos from the project have been adapted for T-shirts and caps.  Hello 6,000 followers! How wonderful to share my #mumbaitaxi #ceiling #art with you.

He's trying to get it shipped to Los Angeles, where he now lives. They may not be sleek and powerful like their modern counterparts but Padmini taxis still have their fans. Recently, Kareem picked up a man in his still-legal Padmini near a railway station. The passenger had a high-end chauffeur-driven car waiting for him. But he got into the cab instead and asked Kareem to follow his car. The man just wanted to take a Padmini taxi, for old times' sake.
Uber, Lyft, Postmates Refuse To Comply With California Gig Economy Law,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/04/793142903/as-california-tries-to-make-contract-workers-employees-industries-push-back,January 4, 2020,

 Postmates, the food delivery platform, is part of a federal lawsuit challenging California's new law that makes it harder to classify workers as contractors. A new law that went into effect in California on Wednesday is supposed to make it harder for companies to hire workers as contractors — but gig companies like Uber, Lyft and the food delivery platform Postmates are refusing to reclassify their fleet of drivers as employees. Supporters of Assembly Bill 5 say companies have been exploiting contract workers for years because they aren't considered employees who get benefits like health coverage and workers' compensation. The law touches many industries, from trucking to tech to certain medical professions. AB5 does include carveouts for professions such as dentists and attorneys. Democratic Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez says misclassification is a problem throughout the economy, but she zeroed in on gig companies during last year's legislative session. "The same week that workers had to go on strike because their per mileage fee was being cut, an investor was celebrating his $30,000 investment that became $120 million in one day," she said during a debate on the Assembly floor in April, shortly after Lyft went public. "Something is wrong with the way that we have allowed these companies to operate." The legislation codifies a ruling from the California Supreme Court that established a new test for classifying workers. Gonzalez says she hopes city attorneys and the state attorney general will hold gig companies responsible if they do not comply with the law. "This is an ongoing battle," she says as the law takes place. Uber and Lyft declined an interview for this story, but they and other gig companies have developed a multipronged strategy to avoid complying with the new law. First, companies are negotiating with lawmakers and labor unions to create an alternate class of worker — basically a contractor with added benefits. Also, earlier this week, Uber and Postmates filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging AB5. Then, there is the nuclear option: Gig companies have sunk more than $100 million into a ballot measure to exempt them from the requirement that they are hoping to put before voters in November. Drivers on all sides of the debate have weighed in. A group called Gig Workers Rising has mobilized drivers to demand better wages and the opportunity to collectively bargain. The group lobbied lawmakers to pass AB5. But others say they fear losing the flexibility that comes with setting their own hours as a contractor.  "With this job, I have the freedom to work when I have time," says Alfonso Martinez, who drives for Uber in the Sacramento area. He says it allows him to balance the demands of being a father to school-aged children who have special needs. Industries such as trucking, journalism and those involved in the gig economy are pushing back by filing suit in federal court. But some companies are scrambling to figure out how to comply. In December, the sports website SB Nation announced it would terminate contracts with hundreds of freelancers in light of California's new labor law. Bradley Geiser and Will Griffith are a couple of those freelance writers. They've contributed interviews, commentary and reporting to the Sacramento Kings blog, Sactown Royalty, for the last five years. Geiser says writing for the blog isn't just about making some money on the side, it has also allowed him to raise his profile as a sports writer. "I don't think I would be where I am, trying to be a writer today, without the opportunity they gave me," he says.  Vox Media, which owns SB Nation, did not respond to a request for comment. The company said it plans to replace the freelancers with a staff of full-time employees, but just how many remains unknown. The new law does provide a specific carveout for freelancers: They can contribute up to 35 submissions per year to a single outlet and still be considered contractors. But a lawsuit filed in federal court by journalism and photography associations argues the law violates the First Amendment. While the two Sacramento-area writers aren't involved in the lawsuit, Griffith says he supports it. "If you can't hold [Uber and Lyft's] feet to the flames, and [the law is] affecting people that it really wasn't supposed to affect, then something needs to be changed — and quick," he says.
The Skyrocketing Cost Of Air Ambulances,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/03/793389441/the-skyrocketing-cost-of-air-ambulances,January 3, 2020, It's the worst day of your life: You've been in a catastrophic accident, and the fastest way to transport you to the hospital is via helicopter, or air ambulance. You are likely too vulnerable, possibly even unconscious, to choose which air ambulance organization will transport you, but the difference in cost between public and private transporters can run to thousands of dollars. Air ambulance transport started as a service provided mainly by hospitals, sometimes even at an operating loss. But in recent years, the air ambulance industry has increasingly privatized, leading to skyrocketing prices. So, what incentivized private groups to invest in air ambulances in the first place, and how are rising costs for the service defying conventional laws of supply and demand?

Oil Prices Reflect Concern, Not Panic, After Airstrike On Iranian General,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/03/793317149/oil-prices-reflect-concern-not-panic-after-air-strike-on-iranian-general,January 3, 2020, Oil is up and stocks are down: It's a predictable response to the dramatic U.S. attack on Iran's powerful military commander as tensions mount in the oil-rich Middle East.  But by historical standards, the reaction from the markets has been muted — at least, so far.   Early Friday, the U.S. military killed Qassem Soleimani, the leader of Iran's Quds Force, in an airstrike in Baghdad. The attack didn't directly affect oil production, and Iran is already under sanctions that keep most of its oil off the global market. But it was a sign of growing conflict. In response, global oil prices rose by about 4% initially, before settling down to a gain of less than 3%.  That pales in comparison to the 14% spike in the price of crude after a September attack on Saudi production facilities that the U.S. and its allies attributed to Iran. And even that jump in prices — triggered by an actual reduction in available oil supplies — was temporary, with the market regaining its footing shortly after. Stocks, meanwhile, faltered slightly on Friday. After starting 2020 with a widespread rally, prominent indexes fell by less than 1%. (Major oil and gas companies were an exception, seeing stocks rise along with rising oil prices.)  It's clear there's uncertainty about the future, and investors are showing concern. But the attack did not immediately prompt wild swings in the markets.  In part, that's because the world oil market has changed dramatically. While Middle Eastern oil is still essential to the world economy, the U.S. — powered by the recent boom in shale oil — is now the largest producer of oil in the world. "It's a new era," says John Kilduff, an energy analyst at Again Capital. "The surge in production by the United States has really created almost a firewall against these geopolitical risks that used to really haunt the oil market and consumers at the gasoline pump."  American shale producers are relatively flexible and could boost production quickly — and they're not the only ones. A global oil glut means that there's plenty of spare capacity, and Saudi Arabia, in particular, could bring more oil online very quickly. The prospect of slightly higher oil prices, meanwhile, may not be as risky for the U.S. economy as it once was, thanks in part to the expansion of the oil industry.  "Higher oil prices tend to cause outlays on capital expenditures in the oil, energy and extraction business, which sometimes will actually more than offset the drag caused by higher gasoline prices," says Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. Compared with 10 or 20 years ago, he says, "we're now in a very different spot."  On the other hand, it's possible there's more risk ahead than investors realize.  If the conflict escalates or spreads, analysts say, oil is likely to rise more in price, and the change this time might be more sustained.  "I think the market ... is still underestimating the impact of tensions in the region," says Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy analyst with the Council on Foreign Relations. "We don't know how the escalation in conflict will play out," she says, noting the risk of missile attacks and cyberattacks on oil producers across the region. "There's a lot of danger all across the Middle East, and it goes beyond oil, obviously." NPR's Scott Horsley contributed to this report.

 This house in Beirut is referred to in court documents as belonging to former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn, who fled Japan where he faced criminal charges and ended up in Lebanon. A wanted notice was delivered to Lebanese authorities on Thursday by Interpol for Carlos Ghosn, three days after the former head of Nissan jumped bail in Japan and surreptitiously fled to Beirut via Turkey.  In addition, seven people suspected of being accomplices in Ghosn's escape to Lebanon have been detained in Turkey. Interpol's Red Notice, as its notification to Beirut is known, is not an international arrest warrant for Ghosn, who is facing financial misconduct charges. It is simply, according to the agency, "a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action."  Lebanese Justice Minister Albert Serhan says Ghosn may be called in for questioning, according to Lebanon's state-owned National News Agency. It quotes Serhan as saying, "The prosecution received the warrant, and it will endeavor to take the required measures related, including the interrogation of [Ghosn]." Because Lebanon has no extradition treaty with Japan, Serhan indicated that Lebanon would "follow its internal laws" in the case.  In an interview with The Associated Press, Lebanon's justice minister says his nation's prosecutors plan to summon Ghosn and hear his side of the story. "I can confirm that the Lebanese state will implement the law," he added. "The prosecution will not stay cross-armed regarding this Red Notice." Also on Thursday, acting Lebanese defense minister Elias Bou Saab told Lebanon's MTV his nation "has no official role" in Ghosn sneaking out of Japan. The 65-year-old auto executive grew up in Lebanon. He has many fans there as well as multiple banking and real estate investments and close ties to top authorities. "A lot of people are very proud of him as a great Lebanese success story, and that's one reason why people support him," Rami Khouri, a journalism professor at the American University in Beirut and a nonresident fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, tells NPR's Morning Edition. "But like everything in Lebanon, it's very split between those who like him and those who think that he's part of the problem of the country."  Two Lebanese lawyers lodged a criminal complaint against Ghosn on Thursday with Beirut's Public Prosecutor's Office, according to NNA. They accuse him of entering Israel and violating a law that requires Lebanese nationals to boycott Israel, which remains in an official state of war with Lebanon.   "We stand in amazement," the lawyers say in a statement, "at the silence of the Lebanese political parties, whom are considered allies of the resistance against Israel, from such security breaches." Ghosn is widely reported to have decided to flee Japan after learning a trial slated for April there would be delayed by a year. He was arrested in Tokyo in November 2018 and charged with financial misconduct; he is accused of making an unauthorized multimillion-dollar payment to a Nissan dealership in Oman. Nissan has also filed embezzlement charges against him.  Ghosn posted $14 million bail last April, ending 108 days' imprisonment. Japanese public broadcaster NHK reports that bail has been revoked.  The auto executive on the lam has French and Lebanese passports in addition to one from his native Brazil.  He was forced to surrender them to his lawyers while out on bail and under house arrest.  But, according Japanese sources cited by NHK, Ghosn was allowed to keep a second French passport in a locked case whose key was also held by his legal team.  Ghosn's supporters contend that after having rescued Nissan from near bankruptcy in the late 1990s, he is being ostracized by Japanese authorities seeking to undermine his efforts to meld Nissan with the French automaker Renault, which he also once headed.  He denies all the charges against him.  Upon arriving in Lebanon, Ghosn issued a statement declaring he was escaping "injustice and political persecution" and added, "I am now in Lebanon and will no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied." On Thursday, the fugitive car boss issued another statement denying his family members played any part in his escape.  "There has been speculation in the media that my wife Carole, and other members of my family played a role in my departure from Japan. All such speculation is inaccurate and false," reads the statement. "I alone arranged for my departure. My family had no role whatsoever." Just who did have a role in Ghosn's mysterious decampment from Japan is under investigation. On Thursday, Turkish police squads detained seven suspects linked to Ghosn's getaway. According to Turkey's Hurriyet Daily News, the apprehended were four pilots, two employees of a ground services company and an operations director for an unnamed courier company. Their detention comes as part of an investigation by Istanbul's Chief Public Prosecutor's Office into Ghosn's having allegedly landed at Istanbul's airport before taking another flight to Lebanon.

 Stock traders in 1987 taking a break in the official Kuwait Stock Exchange, which was created in the aftermath of The Souk al-Manakh crisis with an eye towards preventing future speculative bubbles. In the early 1980s, Kuwait's unofficial stock market — run out of a parking garage on the site of an old camel market — was the third largest in the world, second only to the U.S. and Japan. But then, in an instant, it all came crashing down, plunging Kuwait into a brutal recession that would last for nearly a decade. How is it that a simple financial innovation could create such vast wealth and such devastating chaos? And what can it teach us about the fundamental forces at the heart of modern capitalism?   Today on The Indicator: the story of the Souk al-Manakh and one of the greatest stock bubbles of all time.  Music by Drop Electric. Find us: Twitter / Facebook / Newsletter.
